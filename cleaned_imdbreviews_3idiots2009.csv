Wow this American loves this movie,20 November 2011,9.0,"I asked my co-workers to recommend a Bollywood movie. I expected ""Dumb and Dumber"" by the title. It wasn't that at all. It is more of an inspirational comedy with some serious but good messages. A more accurate title would have been ""The Legend of Rancho"".Odd to me is that they speak in part English, part Hindi through the movie, kinda like some speak ""Spanglish"" here I suppose. I know none of the actors but the acting was good, and there was plenty of humor. The characters were believable. Most movie dancing I find a little silly but I even liked the dancing routines in the bathroom.I will be asking my co-workers for more recommendations after this one!"
Hat-Trick Heroes x 3...,2 October 2020,9.0,"Like Dead Poets Society but with Robin Williams as a student and some extra tonic and spice thrown in for good measure. Serious, sad and silly, often concurrently but overwhelmingly very, very funny and engaging, as engineering students at an Indian college end up teaching as much as they learn. Who could disagree with the distinction between education and learning while recognising the often sizable gulf that exists between the two after watching this. Who would dissuade those with aspiration and passion from pursuing their dreams and goals. Weighing in not too shy of three hours you'll be shocked how quickly the time flies as your attention is vacuumed up and your view of the world turned on its head, or inverted, depending what you've learned."
THE BEST OF BOLLYWOOD; please sing along....,15 June 2021,9.0,"When I was 13, I had my first movie-love;
There was nothing that compared to this movie;
Nobody could eva stop me watchn this cult;
It had me goin crazy, oh I was star-struck!Watched every weekend, didn't need no other work;
Made me laugh made me cry made me become what I am today;
Inspired me, motivated me to achieve success every day;I was choking in the crowd, it made me roar aloud;
I was nowhere in my career, it made me a flourisher;
I used to be havin a bad time, it took me to cloud nine;
I was in pieces, it fixed me;
It made me a it made me a believer, believer.I was in pieces, it fixed me.It gave me another chance, I grew up once again
Na na na.... Na na na.... Na na na.... Na na nana na...."
Wonderfully entertaining.,2 June 2011,9.0,"It's hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.Like so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since ""3 Idiots"" is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.As for the plot, it's very long and involved and I could recount what occurs. But I don't want to spoil a single wonderful moment, so my advice is just sit back and watch--and if you give it a chance, I can almost guarantee you'll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. Wonderful and well worth your time--with a delightful script, wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears. See this film."
Finally a masterpiece from Bollywood. Aamir Khan is the best thing to happen to Bollywood.,9 September 2013,9.0,"Awesome film man. Saw this with my family in a theatre. Worth every penny n worth every minute. Never seen such an amazing film from Bollywood.
What is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. The last 30 mins were beautifully shot. Very good direction by Hirani. The star cast is good n Aamir khan steals the show.
The editing is top notch. U don't feel bore for even a sec. Awesome screenplay. It's hands down the best film in the history of Bollywood."
Missed this gem for 12 years - Thanks to my wife,2 May 2021,9.0,"Thought provoking movie, it shows how Indian Parents force their children's. In every aspects (what to study, what to wear, where to work, so & so.Really if i had seen this movie before 12 years, my life would have been different.Must seeeee!!!!!!"
easily the best Indian movie in 2009.... and one of the best ever,24 December 2009,10.0,"I was lucky to see the first day show of 3 idiots on Thursday in Dubai. Well the title of this post says it all. The movie is an example of classic film making. brilliant and highly entertaining.Watch 3 idiots for a) amir khan's incredible acting b) intelligent and highly energatic screenplay & direction (Rajkumar Hirani has done it yet again!) c) amazing chemistry among actors, d) some of the best comedy scenes coming from Indian cinema in a long time and e) a heart warming story which keeps you spell binded right till the end.I would rate it as among the best from amir khan (which obviously means among the very best from bollywood. I would also give a lot of credit to the director rajkumar hirani, who after this movie (and his previous munna bhai series) should rank as among the top in bollywood too. 9/10."
One of the better Bollywood movies I saw,6 February 2016,10.0,"Because the movie had such a high rating on IMDb I was intrigued. Bollywood movies are not particularly on the top of my list I must admit. But I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. It only has two scenes where they start singing and dancing so that was not too much. Why they start singing and dancing that I will never get. The story does not need that at all. The story itself was very pleasant to follow. Full of mixed emotions, happy ones and sad ones. The cast and the filming was great. All actors gave a good performance throughout the whole movie. Like in most American television series they want to give you a lesson in life and most of the time it makes me want to barf but in this Bollywood movie it works perfectly well. I had fun watching this and I get why I am not the only one. Certainly worth a watch."
"Good, but they overdid it.",28 December 2009,10.0,"I was eager to watch this movie as the only bollywood films i like are those of aamir khan. When i saw the trailer of the movie, i thought that this movie could be the best of all time in bollywood, but it considerably failed to be. The plot was somewhat interesting , the cast was very appropriate, the acting was superb, the dialogues were wonderful , but the director maybe oozing with overconfidence, tried to put just too much in it. He tried to put it in ALL the good and bad things a teenager should do while he is in college. It was hard to identify the real protagonist in this movie, and even in the end i was left wondering whether raju was the man in the spotlight or aamir. What i hate to watch and hear is a meaningless song with meaningless lyrics and meaningless dance. And thats just what was very prominent in the movie. I don't understand the purpose of such futile non-sense, is it because people like it ? OH REALLY??? or is it because the director finds it attractive? attractive like - cow dung over cake.!? Another flaw i noticed was the change in character of aamir - from when he was a small kid to his teenage years. He looked and behaved like the most innocent one and out-of-all-activities one and later he became the most notorious and daring guy in college. Let the movie be pathetic or super-hit , boman irani was as always at his peak. His character was very well presented and he did just fine enough to make him the funniest as well as the most brutal character in the movie. The movie also had a lot of dramatic, sensitive scenes, at the wrong times, which did at times bring tears in my eyes, and left the other brain-left-at-home audience sob while staring at the screen. I wont say anything about Kareena because there isn't any need to publicize her flaws, there's a need to look for the minimal positivity in her enacting of her cameo. Rest was very appeasing , it was a pleasure to watch nonetheless, and the film was worth watching. 7/10"
"3 hours of stereotypes, melodrama and rehashed jokes from the nineties",29 December 2009,10.0,"I got to see this movie at a special screening before it hit the theaters. The high expectation was palpable. After all, Aamir Khan has been producing successive hits over the years. Now for the movie - which starts in an engineering college in India, goes on to show the lives of three of its students through the years till they graduate. This being a Bollywood film, obviously has a smattering of romance and song and dance sequences. Right from the start where Aamir jaywalks into the college building without a care in the world to the time he starts questioning the teaching methods in class, its just a matter of a couple of days. Some cheeky guy this is! Unfortunately, all his antics and funny lines are as old as the college building he is in. You would have heard these jokes a hundred times over. Anyways, that is the best part of the film since it at least elicits a few laughs. The rest of the 3 hours is filled with stereotypes and melodramatic scenes which are ridiculous at best. It seems that these days in India, anyone who can make the audience cry can laugh all the way to the bank. Aamir has this knowledge and isn't afraid to use it."
more than just a laugh...taught me great life lessons as well,1 March 2011,10.0,"I'm from the Philippines. For years, I have always been curious about Indian cinema. I've seen clips of Indian films on cable TV and to be honest...I just don't get it. I don't get all the silly dancing and singing in almost all movies. I find it so corny and irrelevant to the story. But don't get me wrong, Philippine movies back in the 80's were also filled with corny singing and dancing. But we have gone past those and transitioned into movie-making based on good scripts...rather than cheesy story lines. When a friend of mine recommended this movie, I haven't really heard of it. I thought it was a Hollywood release but it wasn't. It was a Bollywood movie. He said it was really funny, so out of curiosity, I got hold of a copy. My first thought was that it was nothing but a silly story of 3 guys doing slapstick comedy that I have all seen before. When they started singing ""All iz well.."" I told myself... I knew it! Just what I thought.But as the movie progressed...I was amazed at the intelligence embedded in this movie. I was so impressed with the smart dialogues delivered by Amir Khan. It was so mature and thought-provoking. The life crisis all of them were in... the pressures at school..the pressures from society and the pressures from family as well... they rang so true. I was even at one time crying my heart out. I can't believe it! All the preconceived notions about a Bollywood movie were obliterated. I was so moved by this picture and I have no regrets seeing it."
Best moive,14 April 2021,10.0,Best of all. The way of narrating the story touches the soul in the heart because the college life which we go through it have shown so many rules when it will start imagining in your own real life that is really true in every life we have certain role and we have to go through it.
"This Christmas & New Year, go gift yourselves - watch this phenomena (Not for Professors) !",25 December 2009,10.0,"I'm an IITian myself and hence, needless to say, was looking forward to this movie as it is based on the life in IITs. I went with my family and watched the first-day-first-show and was I pleased ? In one sentence - The best Bollywood movie ever ! If you are into movies, then this one is not to be missed unless you are the 4th idiot. I cried, I laughed and I enjoyed every moment of the 3 hours that I spent watching this gem. The songs that seemed mediocre before watching the movie, feel like perfect for the movie. They are so ideal for the situations that I just loved them.As you can understand, they could not bring the name of any IIT into the movie to avoid disputes. But trust me, whatever they have shown about the life in IITs, it's all true. Right from suicides, cold-hearted Professors to lack of encouragement and support for talents who can really bring serious change in this world. The movie successfully depicts how once inside, your life is only about meaningless grades, go get into the race before it's too late.Take my free advice and avoid any reviews or words from people who have already seen the movie. Don't let anyone spoil any scene from the movie. Rush to the nearest theater and experience the phenomenon for yourself. You'll bless me for this advice !"
Aamir has yet again chased excellence & success follows him !,24 December 2009,10.0,"Plot Two idiots Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman) sets outs on a journey to find their lost friend and the 3rd idiot Rancho (Aamir).. As the journey starts off, their college life and old memories of their friendship, with a unique free-thinker Rancho who inspired them and changed their lives, are unfolded through flashbacks and followed with some twists and turns...My Views 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurizes the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it... On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to ""Five Point Someone"", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...Both humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...Technically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...Coming to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...On the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer's liberty and the episode of Mona's delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that ""chase excellence and success will follow"".. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...So to sum up, Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...Verdict : THE BEST of 2009 ! Rating : 9/10for more reviews of the latest Indian movies, visit www.snehasallapam.com"
This inspires me to watch more Bollywood movies,20 September 2017,10.0,"Until recently my only exposure to Indian cinema was Satyajit Ray. Like a lot of Americans, my knowledge of Bollywood was based entirely on film clips and American take-offs of lavish musical numbers.I searched a few lists of top Bollywood films and settled on 3 Idiots, which turned out to be a wonderful decision. The movie is terrifically funny and engaging, seamlessly moving from comedy to tragedy to musical numbers.The story centers around a brilliant, iconoclastic technical student who spends the movie telling people to follow their dreams. While generally lighthearted, the movie strongly addresses the apparently terrible stresses on Indian college students. But in spite of some dark moments, overall this is about as feel-good as you can get. Feel-good to an absurd degree? Sure. But what's so bad about feeling good?When I think of Bollywood I think of big musical numbers, and there are a handful here, although they're a tiny part of the three-hour running time. Still, they are tremendous fun.To sum up, I saw a Bollywood movie, I laughed, I cried, and now I want to see more.UPDATE: I saw more. So many good movies out there!"
Great Entertainer / but Story and Character holes,17 February 2010,10.0,"3 Idiots is way too short a movie, which is simply another way of saying that it is an extremely entertaining movie! Raju Hirani has served an hat trick. Three great movies in a row. Raju has brought his Gandhigiri to the world of education, this time the Gandhian is Rancho.Acting is great by Boman Irani, Sharman Joshi and the best Omi Vaidya or Chatur, without whom 3 idiots would not have been what it is.Its almost impossible to find any significant deviations to excellence when you have a team like this one. Raju, Boman, Aamir, the perfectionist to name a few.But there were a couple of things under the surface that disturbed me a little bit.To start with the easy one, When you anger your senior in the first 5 minutes of entering the college, you know for sure it cannot end there. So from that point of view, the ragging scene mysteriously ends prematurely. Another one is, Boman Iirani or Virus knows Rancho's dad's monthly income but not his address? They spend 10 years searching for him, why didn't they check the college register?Now for some serious ones.I like Aamir Khan movies because you never ever ever see Aamir, you only see the character he is playing, which is exactly how it should be. Unlike Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan movies where you see the movie stars instead of their characters (exceptions apply of course, for example in ""Chak de India"" you couldn't find Shah Rukh even if you wanted to). In 3 idiots, I got to see Aamir Khan more than a couple of times and I was surprised. That got me thinking, why would our perfectionist entertainer allow for something like this.The plot thickens and the mystery deepens. Hmmmm. So I dug deeper and eventually hit the gold mine. Its not Aamir, it's his character Rancho which has a fundamental flaw that even Aamir could not overcome. Rancho is projected as someone who loves to learn, he wants to take in every ounce of knowledge he can absorb for any source possible. But his actions are that of a revolutionary, from teaching the director on how to teach to mocking the definitions of machines and books. On one side he is a sponge, an introvert on the other hand he is a rebel, and extrovert. These opposites needed reconciliation in the story.Somewhere along the way, even meanness crept in. I am referring to Chatur's switched speech. Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed every bit of that scene. But that does not mean that it flowed with Rancho's character. I think the writers mixed up Aamir's earlier characters, Aakash from Dil Chahta Hai would do this in a heartbeat, DJ from ""Rang de Basanti"" would probably go one step beyond, but not Rancho and definitely not for a ""demo"". Rancho is pure, or at least that's what Raju is portraying him. The same goes with the climax. Now, even though, all of us cheered when Chatur got shafted towards the end in a strange twist of fate. Some how I had a hard time believing that filing 400 patents and signing with the Japanese gel well with this Gandhian educator.Aamir, in his interview, mentioned his approach to looking young in the movie. His pacings, mannerisms, style of dialogue delivery etc. He executes brilliantly on them.Madhavan is decent. He could have been much better.Omi Vaidya, or Chatur, is the real find of this movie. Hope to see more from him.One additional aspect which is not easily apparent is that this is one of the few movies that projects intelligence with the coolness it deserves, and not in the traditional Hollywood style of nerd portrayal. This is a better role model for students. Towards that end it is on par with Matrix.To make it clear, this movie is vastly more entertaining than most of the movies of 2009. But I am not comparing this movie with other movies, that would be like comparing apples with windows. I am comparing this to other Aamir and Raju Herani movies. And in that comparison, this does not shine as bright.______________________Now, here's what I would have changed if I was in control.* Raggers are caught by the director and are convinced without any ""pressure"" not to rag any more * Reconcile Rancho's character's fundamental flaw, requires serious deep dive * Motivation for Chatur's speech prank redone, maybe not even instigated by Rancho * Some better reason why nobody can find Rancho * Redo the Javed Jaffery scene where he talks to his dead father, turning the tables to show that Javed actually wanted to take his father to Disney Land but his father kept on insisting that they wait for the highway contract to go thru. That would be hilarious. * Sharman Joshi's family is so central to him but are missing 10 years later, in the starting scene, some how bring them in. Maybe his wife is on the phone talking to his sister, happily married in Bombay, when she yells ""No Pants"".This review was originally posted on my blog: http://roundhayreview.blogspot.com/2010/01/3-idiots.html"
3 idiots is a masterpiece and easily one of the greatest Bollywood movies of all time,24 December 2009,9.0,"I saw the paid premiere of 3 idiots today.On the whole, 3 idiots is a winner all the way everythingwise.3 idiots suits the term 'landmark cinema' and has all it takes to help Bollywood take a giant step into world cinema with pride.3 idiots is a sparkling example of qualitative cinema.3 idiots not only entertains, it also enlightens.3 idiots is forward-thinking, but also makes you recall your roots. It promises lots of laughs and also a heartwarming message.There are movies aplenty, but very few remain etched in your memory and possess recall value. 3 idiots is one of those films. Indisputably and undeniably, this Aamir-Madhavan-Sharman outing is worth the price of the ticket and more.The film will set new records and has the merits to emerge one of the biggest hits of all times. The weekend business should be historic, the Week 1 business should be unparalleled, the lifetime gross should be amongst the biggest of all times. In short, 3 idiots has 'Blockbuster' written all over it.The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. You aren't restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong film-making can enhance and elevate an already solid concept.An Aamir Khan film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up, 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has 'Hit' written all over it. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director Rajkumar Hirani strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives 3 idiots to the winning post."
One of the best movie of decade,24 December 2009,10.0,"Aamir does it again. what a movie .from start to the end, hilarious moments.screenplay is fantastic. full on comedy and yet it never looses its heart. Aamir pulls off a 22 year old character with brilliance. never for once you feel you are watching aamir .It was rancho on screen. sharman n madhavan - i bow down to them. music looks OK on cd but during movie it worked as a plus point. situational tracks works in the favour of film. runtime may sound a bit too much but believe me, you wont know when the first half is over. second half may seem a bit too hilarious but apart from that its a masterpiece. gr8 aamir ,another brilliant movie.10/10"
Best Movie of 2009! Aamir Khan reigns Supreme!!,24 December 2009,10.0,"We saw a sneak preview of 3 Idiots last night at Globus Cinema in Bandra, Mumbai.Brilliant. Simply, brilliant.Simple but articulate story telling laced with lots of humour and lessons from life. A wonderful experience to watch as every single actor from Sharman, Madhavan, Boman, Kareena & Aamir deliver probably the best performance in a movie this year.Sharman & Madhavan start off on a journey to seek out their friend Rancho. Together they were the 3 Idiots in college. And they take us the viewers with them on this beautiful journey with such warmth, panache, humour and love, that we don't want the journey to end.Sharman really shows why he's one actor to watch out for. His acting genes come through in every single scene. He's perfect in his role. Sharman, you rock!Madhavan as the guy who's chasing his father's dreams rather than his own is wonderful. The character who learns to laugh at life and it's ironies thanks to his friend Rancho. Madhavan shows his humorous side brilliantly savoring every scene and making it a pleasure to watch. His narration of the movie is very good.Boman Irani is probably the one actor we take most for granted just because he's so brilliant! His characterization of the control-crazy, hyper-active, hyper-competitive, almost dictator-ish, college principal, is beyond words. He plays it so so well, that you love to hate him. He's that Good.Kareena comes through in this movie as one of the finest actresses we have. No one else could have played her part and also looked so beautiful at the same time.And now take it from a hard core Amitabh Bachchan fan, Aamir Khan is the best actor in town today after AB. Period.His range is phenomenal and his characterization of 'Rancho' in this movie is positively brilliant. The small mannerisms, the walk, the smile, the attitude, the brilliance of a young person who's not restricted by the educational system, his positive attitude towards every thing in life, it's Rancho you are looking at. Not Aamir. Aamir's ability to transform himself convincingly from the super-huge well-built temporary amnesia patient on a revenge spree in Ghajini to this whacked out college student, which is half the age he played in last movie shows his prowess as a master actor to transcend age barriers to play almost every role in the book.This is THE best movie of 2009. Aamir again reigns supreme. Thank you Raju Hirani & Vidhu Vinod Chopra.Cliché word, but I have to use it - FANTASTIC !! 10/10 P.S. Don't forget to say 'Aal Izz Well'"
One of the best movies that make you laugh and cry and think at the same time,1 July 2014,10.0,"This is the first Bollywood movie I have seen. (I don't know if ""Slum dog millionaire"" is also an Indian movie or not.) I have learned from my parents long ago that Indian movies are excellent and full of dance scenes. They watched quite a few Indian movies when they were youngsters.Then I had my first experience of watching a Bollywood movie quiet by accident. It was during the sports meet held by the school in which I teach English. I was appointed to do some work using the computer, which we would run some movies when we were free. And the first movie was ""3 Idiots."" I don't know who picked the movie. To be honest, I never would have picked this one myself because of its stupid Chinese title, which, translated back into English, is ""3 idiots who make scenes in Bollywood"". I expected to see a movie that was funny from beginning to end and that could be enjoyed without your brain working too hard. It turned out to be way more than that. It's a movie that made me laugh uncontrollably at some points, shed tears at other points and think all the time.It's about friendship, dream, love and college education. I think the best part is about college education. The situation depicted in the film is almost the same as in China. As a teacher in a high school in China, I know exactly what problems we have in education. What shows in the movie is exactly what happens in China right now. We attach so much importance to grades that teachers and parents will do anything to improve their study, which causes a lot of students' losing interest in study. I recommend all Chinese educators see this movie. I myself have watched it for at least 6 times, including those times I watched it in my class with my students.I give it a ten."
A wise person may look like an idiot: Chinese proverb,2 September 2011,10.0,"I missed it during the 2010 Hong Kong International Film Festival and am really glad it is released publicly.Haven't seen such a feel good movie for a long time. Excellent and inspiring plot with very positive messages and many hilarious scenes.Inspiring messages and witty lines are dotted throughout the movie, intertwined with some teary scenes: all is well if you follow your passion; chase excellence and success will follow; be brave and follow your dream; think outside the box and be flexible.It challenges our current values on education and success – that we should learn for the sake of learning but not for grades or what others want us to do. What's the point if you memorize everything but do not understand what it means and do not know how to put what you have learned into application? What an inspiring movie. It challenges your comfort thinking mode and urge you to be yourself and chase your dream/passion.Excellent acting, colorful and typical Bollywood musical scenes with uplifting songs and dance moves, not to mention the soothing natural scenery interspersed in the moving episodes of friendship, love, family and playful/stressful campus life.Every student, teacher, and parent or anyone who cares about our future should see it. What kind of world do we want to live in? What kind of person do we want our next generation to be? What kind of lives do we want to lead? This movie makes us ponder on these.Somehow the movie echoed Steve Job's quotes : ""Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people's thinking."" ""Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."" Both Steve and the Rancho character (Aamir Khan) are smart and creative, nice and helpful to friends and people who are willing to learn. They are true to their feelings. They dare to challenge authority and encourages others to do the same. We need more people like these in this world.Just go see it. You won't regret it."
GOOD in comedy but somewhat below expectation!!!,3 January 2010,10.0,"i recently saw 3idiots in fun cinemas. obviously as the title suggests its a comedy cinema based on intelligent & loving idiots. movie's basic theme as it was promoted as engineering college film follows it before first half , but in the second half it simply becomes an idiotic desi Indian cinema with lot of foolish incidents. this is good to cover and attract audience but failed to become a college classic. we expect a lot from rajkumar hirani, though he had made a good cinema but i still say he was best in his munnabhai series..go if u want to see completely bollywood ishtyle Hindi cinema based on funny college incidents..i simply give 7.5/10.."
"""Aal izz well"".",2 November 2017,10.0,"Never would I have thought that a movie that looked this stupid on paper could have turned out so good. Just looking at the DVD cover would have been enough to turn this film back in but it shows up in IMDb's Top #250 so I thought I'd give it a try. It didn't start out that well for me but before long the movie's magic began to take hold. Not that there's anything daringly new about it's message; it all has to do with believing in one's self and doing what you really want to do with your life after one's formal education is completed.Aamir Khan is a potent anchor for the story of three college friends attending the Imperial College of Engineering, and Rancho's ideas about success don't revolve around getting the best grades but actually learning something. I could see somebody like a younger Matthew Perry performing the role if this was an American film. I wasn't really expecting as much in the way of music from this story, but with the amount of song and dance you could almost call it a musical. The 'Zoobi Doobi' dance number was quite infectious and looked like a lot of fun.Another thing that keeps you engaged is the non-linear story telling technique. But the thing is, you never really get confused when the time line changes from ten years ago to present day. With all the humorous situations presented, this could have easily fallen into slapstick, and it did get close at times, but then the story pulled back with a poignant message or a sobering decision one of the characters had to make. Story threads are tied up that one forgets along the way and that's another cool element. I just thought it was a uniquely creative film with a neat twist at the end with the identity of Rancho. There's even a romance thrown in for our principal player, and when it was over, I had the feeling that this is what ""La La Land"" could have been but never came close."
only for idiots,27 December 2009,10.0,"This was a good year for Indian cinema, with movies like Dev.D,Gulal, Siddharth: the Prisoner and Kaminey giving a new direction. I was expecting that 3 idiots will be like a Lassi after having a spicy Panjabi Dinner but alas, Aamir disappointed once again. I do not mind losing my 200 bugs, but surely mind losing my precious hair. This movie is very loosely based upon Five point some one and has done balatakar of it. you will feel sleepy after listening Aamir's boring lecture about, life and education. He makes extra efforts to look like a student which unfortunately failed miserably. In the first half in a scene Aamir goes to one of his room mate's home. That scene makes such a mockery of their poverty that i feel like slapping the director. If that scene is not enough to cause headache, than baby delivery scene in the second half surely does. And than comes the Aamir's great invention, making a inventor for the cars batteries, wow that will make even Einstein proud. The only positive thing about the movie is some two or three good one liner and two songs."
Haven't Tasted any other movie like This one,27 February 2021,10.0,"This Movie Is an art and Rajkumar hirani is The Artist. The first time I saw this movie, I became a big fan of Amir Khan, although the first time I did not see the whole. After that, every time I watched this movie, I became a fan of each and every character. This is my most watched movie of my life. Loved it!"
Don't BE A STUPID BE AN I.D.I.O.T. ! must watch.,25 December 2009,9.0,"Yesterday i watched 3 I.D.I.O.TS(I Do it On My terms)the most entertaining and simply the best movie of this decade after RDB. a movie with a message(chase excellence success will follow)without loosing its sense of humor,a movie about friendship and love,a movie about flawed education system, a movie about unhealthy competition.this movie is team work ,every one does its part very well. Aamir (what a actor he is!!!)is excellent as Rancho ,Madhavan and Sharman are perfectly in sync(watch both of them in drunk scene), Kareena is OK,Boman played director's character as good as it was possible,Omi was top notch (watch Chamatkar \Balatkar scene),But whenever the team wins credit goes to captain,and here the captain is Rajkumar hirani.He gave 'Jaadu Ki Jhappi 'in MB,'Gandhigiri' in LRMB and now he says 'ALL IZZ WELL' and believe me he is 100% right.Dialogues: Witty with humor and to the point, Chamatkar \Balatkar scene is one of the best comic scenes . Music: Shantanu Moitra's music also have a role in the movie,all the songs come alive on the screen,(watch Zoobie-Doobie and Aal Izz Well)FINAL WORDS: its like a marriage between RDB and Lage Raho Munnabhai. no doubt there is some MASALA but we indians like it . Rating: FIVE POINT SOMETHING OUT OF FIVE.Don't BE A STUPID BE AN I.D.I.O.T. ! must watch."
All is kinda well for 3 idiots. It was mostly a great feel-good movie.,11 August 2015,9.0,"In a country, where over-achievement is expected & anything deem a normal life is look upon as the idiotic or lazy failure. A lot of Asians feel, that slaving away, their lives, for the chance of extraordinary wealth is the only way, to live, even if it's does not suite their personality. Indeed, the hunger for success and wealth is so engrained in Asian culture, that it's hard to escape, such burdens. It's true, that Asians societies, do put extreme pressure on its members. Often, weighting down on them to a point, that some people feel, that it's too much; causing them to common suicide. So, I can see, why people would want to see this film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. It has a more healthy and positive approach when it comes to a country's wants and don't wants, when it comes to the individual member. Set in an India academia world, 3 Idiots revolves around three students studying in the Imperial College of Engineering, in New Delhi. The first idiot, Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) comes from a poor family and is desperate to pass and get a good job, but lacks the self-esteem to go with his plans. The second idiot, Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), comes from a relatively better family, but has joined engineering to please his family, while he really wants to become a wildlife photographer. The last idiot, Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchhad (Aamir Khan) is a radical-thinking young man, who more willing to challenges the educational system at every step he takes, rather than accenting the harsh-crude teaching practices of the college, often infuriating the headmaster of the school, Viru 'The Virus' Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani). However, Farhan and Raju lost contact with Rancho after graduation. Ten years later, Farhan gets a call from an old enemy colleague of theirs, Chature 'Silencer' Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) who says he has found Rancho. Abandoning everything, Chatur, Farhan and Raju set out on a road trip, to find him. But all is not as it seems. Can the idiots find their friend or will the search end up as a wild goose chase? Watch the movie, to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to look at the film, in a western world view set and say, the Animal House style college scenes, far out-live the present day, road trip movie. I really felt, those scenes were far, more effective, even if the social message was somewhat too broad. I like that, the modern day teaching standards are called into question. It made a very interesting film. Sadly, the movie takes the often funny yet brilliant Patch Adam like, school challenges, and mixed it, with below average Bollywood film dramatics. The movie often moves into such clichés, that it become somewhat emotional jarring to watch. One minute, you're listening to a Bollywood musical dance number, and then, you cut to an emotional, over the top preachy death scene. The pacing for the film is all over the place. It really drags at times. Some of the film's greatest twist comes inappropriate mistimed. You'd know that Raju will survive his suicide attempt since he's alive and well in the present day scenes. You know, that the men will end up, being successful, regardless, what the Virus pull onto them. Don't get me wrong, the twist about Racho's past was pretty good, but the film was pretty predictable. Then, there are the unrealistic over the top scenes that are absolutely nearly implausible in any universe, like the whole stubborn baby scene. Anyways, the acting, throughout the film was pretty good. Each character had a moment to shine. My only problem with the acting is Kareen Kapoor as Pia. She was so disappointing, most of the film. I really don't get her character. Why would she still go after, Suhas (Olivier Lafont), after three-times, where characters warn her, not to!? It doesn't make sense. Plus, that noise ring, she wore, during the film was so distracting. Another thing that kinda hurts the film is the songs. Shantanu Moitra's score is a bit too gimmicky. The song, Zoobi Doobi sounds entertaining, but sounds too similar to other Bollywood songs. The song 'All Izz Well' sounds like it should had been, put in the credits than in the middle of the film. Anyways, I love the over-the-top childish humor. While, the jokes are simple and old. They work mostly within the means of the story. Chatur's engineered speech is by far, the funniest scene in the film. Still, the movie does seem, a bit, one-sided when it comes to condone misbehavior. I'm deeply surprise that the three men, wasn't kick out of the school, within the first couple of minutes in the film. Much of the film's controversy, comes from the fact, that the movie is loosely based on the novel, Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhaget. Any fan of the book, would know, that the film is way different. The suicide message of the book, get somewhat lose in the film. Yes, within the last five years, India has one of the greatest absolute numbers of suicides cases, but here is where the movie get some of the information, wrong. Other countries have the highest rates, overall. It's also untrue, that extreme pressures of academia cause most of India's suicide rates. Farmers are more likely to kill themselves, versus any other professions in India, as list by the World Health Organization. Despite that, the film is fun for the most part. The film is distinctive for featuring real inventions by little-known people. The cinematography is beautiful to look at. I love the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh. The film felt like a typical masala film. It's good to eat, but a bit too spicy, at same moments. No wonder, why this film is one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films ever. Overall: While it's kinda overrated. It's emotional, entertaining and enlightening. In my opinion, it was a somewhat above averaged Bollywood film."
One of the best films I had never heard of!,21 March 2021,7.0,"I have a list of top 100 films ever made and honestly most of them don't live up to their hype, 3 idiots however deserves to be on that list 100%. This film has everything from a diverse cast, to a realistic respectful romance, to accurate and emotional portrayal of suicide and burdens parents put on their children to a well written strong and funny female character and last but not least an amazingly written main character who is played fantastically well. I had not heard of this film but am so I glad i found it! I laughed, I cried, I was utterly confused and i will not be forgetting this film anytime soon. To anyone who has not seen this film GO AND WATCH IT! You won't regret it."
Simply Awesome!! You gotta watch it to believe it!,25 December 2009,7.0,"After some really bad experiences with Hindi Movies especially Mangal Pandey, I stopped watching any Hindi movie during first 3 days of its release and normally downloads them from internet except Aamir's movies. Though I have been eagerly waiting to watch 3 Idiots but still I read some 6-7 reviews on different websites before going to the movie. All of the reviews were positive so I decided to spend my money this time on theatre on first day first show.Pros1. Lots of hilarious scenes a. The Teacher's Day speech By Omi: Even if I give you the whole script of the scene, I can bet that you will definitely burst out laughing while watching this scene (an aged sardar had to go out of theatre because he couldn't handle so much laughter in the scene) . b. Scene at Sharman's house where these 3 had dinnerc. Kareena's Sister wedding scened. And lots of one liners too2. Awesome acting by Aamir After watching Ghajini, you will be amazed to see how this guy managed to transform himself into a 20+ college going student and actually looks like one. The spontaneity especially in the scene when he talked to Boman Irani during the cremation of a student makes him the best actor bollywood has ever produced 3. Camaraderie between Aamir, Sharman and MadhvanAfter RDB, this triplet has done it yet again!! See the scene where they are drinking on stairs and Sharman and Madhvan challenge Aamir4. Chemistry between Aamir & Kareena All efforts goes to Aamir for this who manages to look so young that this pair never looks odd and chemistry between them was also amazing5. Realizations in the characters All the characters except Rancho (Simply because I haven't find or heard of such a genius till now) in the film seems real and you can relate them to one or other in your real life. This brings the film all the more close to your heart6. Message of the film A well-deserved strike on the existing education system where rot learning has become part of the life of every student (including myself who followed the blind race of Engineering & MBA without knowing what I really want to do) 7. Finally, each and every character in the movie fits in his/her role and has gone their true potential. There are many scenes to see that too like Sharman's dilemma and breakdown during one of his interaction with Boman, The way Boman's carries himself as an intelligent but cynic principal, Omi's character etc.8. SongsHonestly telling, before watching the movie I didn't like the songs very much but after the movie I am in love with them especially Give me some sunshine, All Izz well and Zoobi DoobiCons1. Kareena eloping from her marriageThis seems a little bit dramatic in an otherwise realistic movie but considering the whole movie I can bear with this five minutes part and in fact going by the reaction of other audiences, you will love this scene also. 2. Mona Singh Delivery SceneAgain, the thing which was indigestible for me was how a person can manage to create a suction device via a vacuum cleaner in such a short time and that makes Rancho an unrealistic person but I guess this is Indian Cinema and no movie can be a complete reality (this applies to Munna Bhai Series, Aamir's all movies, in fact I should not be talking about realism in Shahrukh's movie) Overall, this movie is worth every single penny of your ticket and you won't regret spending even 300 bucks on this movie. This is guaranteed!!"
Don't judge this book by its cover!,3 July 2011,9.0,"This movie hit on all cylinders. It was fun, funny, deep, intelligent, thought provoking, and seriously entertaining. It is not a dumb comedy, rather a very smart (and humorous) look at the struggles of engineering students in India.I thought I would have trouble with the subtitles, but after about 10- minutes I was completely 100% engrossed in the movie. The wife loved every bit of it.My single and only criticism is the length of the movie. I believe there were one or two too many situations which kind of caused the movie to drag.Otherwise I thoroughly loved it.Do not be fooled by the idiotic picture on the cover of this movie. And the first 5-minutes of the movie are not indicative of the brilliance of the rest of the film. It is not stupid humor (even though I like stupid humor).You will leave this movie being glad you watched it. Trust me."
Engineering College Redemption,25 December 2009,9.0,"The movie is supposed to be based on Chetan Bhagat's guideline for IITs Five Point Someone.It not entirely true to it.and in the end it does take a turn that is reminiscent of the ever loving Shawshank Redemption in more ways than one.such as Sharman Joshi's candid confession in an interview besides the end!The film manages a comic depth,what it, at much of the times lacks is emotional depth.It treats issues too naively perhaps.It creates caricatures out of Bhagat's characters.it does hinder character development.Boman Irani's Dean Viru Sahastrabudhhe(VIRUS) did remind me of his own Dr.Asthana in Hirani's debut Munnabhai M.B.B.S. Asthana's funny guffaws were character traits but Virus hasn't any he tries to be whatever is required.He is funny,he is ruthless but never as formidable as Asthana. 3I is not par stereotypes thus is predictable.It also delves in silliness and goes from melodramatic extremes to comic extremes in seconds.But all said the movie is just too funny. I have not laughed so much in days.Its certainly written better than the novel(apparently not a difficult thing to do).Lead Performances are very good too.In the end its easily lovable but forgettable unlike LRMunnabhai.Its not at all a bad movie but maybe just not brilliant.Lead Actor's own Taare Zameen Par would be a brilliant document on education system.I rate it 7/10."
A Must Watch!,25 December 2009,7.0,"Rajkumar Hirani... the name is enough to create an excitement in any cinema-fan alive. Munnabhai series have been awesome films, and his latest offering '3 Idiots' is another Masterstroke from this genius.I have no idea how 5-point-someone is, all I know is that '3 Idiots' is an amazing/awesome/inspiring film. A treat of a film! A film that is rich in emotions, A Film that leaves behind a great moral. The Youth are sure to worship this Film, and that will make this film a blockbuster. Cancel anything you're planning to do till the 31st, watch '3 Idiots', it's worth your time and money. Hirani and Joshi's script is simply superb. Through Humor how many rights and wrongs are said. I really loved the way Hirani showed us Sharman's family. A typical 1950's family, it's hilarious as well as genius.The film has Superb Performances: Aamir is fantastic as Funsok Wang Do. He's a delight every time he appears on screen and delivers his careers finest work. Maddy excels, he's astounding in the sequence when he shares his heart with his father. Sharman Joshi is good, yet again. Omi is a Masterstroke. A surprise packet, his speech sequence is sure to be remembered forever! Kareena is weak. Boman Irani is mind-blowing as the vicious head. He leaves you speechless in the scene when he awards Aamir The Pen. Mona is average.The Music is decent, with 'All Izz Well' being a complete chart-buster. The cinematography is perfect. All other departments are satisfactory.Watch this film right now..."
I Laughed! I Cried! And I'm giving this a 10!,7 March 2013,7.0,"When I was looking through IMDb's Top 250 movie list and saw a movie called ""3 Idiots"", I was surprised. Why would a movie with such a bad title be voted so highly? I went in thinking this would be India's version of Animal House or American Pie. But after watching the film, I was in love! It is so much more than the usual college story of young guys getting drunk, flunking classes, and getting back at their superiors. It is an extremely well-made film about doing what you love and facing your fears. The acting is incredible by the ensemble cast. The script is funny and poignant at the same time. Even the scenery is breathtaking. Although the length of the film is pretty long and has some quirky musical numbers, 3 Idiots is a delight. It is worth the watch!"
"Americans, Enough, This movie is that good!!!!!!!",19 May 2013,2.0,"Well, at least it is in Asian's Mind. It's SO GODDAMN GOOD for Asians.You don't get the high school thing so you think it's overrated. Well, Dark Knight and The Avengers are overrated for us because we don't get the superheroes thing. But so what? Still, a lot of people love it, so Stop Taking Your Personal feelings as The Lethal Truth. To make you understand better. Let me tell you something about the high school thing. If you have studied in Chinese or Indian High school you will understand what's all about the suicide and sad plot. Life was like a pis of sh!t. You have to wake up at 6:30 and go to bed after like 10:30, you can never choose your class, you can never say anything that against the teacher, you can never be in relationship with boys or girls. Right here, NO PARTY, NO PROM, NO NOTHING. All you have to do and all you can do is study and study, and the only way to make your life better is to get good grades. Because of the hard works and lack of fun, you're totally exhausted while the teachers and parents keep complains that you're lazy. And what's even funnier, is that 80% of what you have struggled to learn has nothing to do with your future life. So it simply sucks here.That's why we love the film, it showed our mind, it's not a perfect movie. But it make us laugh and cry. This movie is 9.1 in douban.com(A Really Famous Website in China)It's 8 out of 10 for us, and even for some of you. For some of you, it's 6 or 7 out of 10. So, it's 8.1 for average. NOTHING IS WRONG. So, please, try to understand."
A Nutshell Review: 3 Idiots,26 December 2009,10.0,"When I told a friend that 3 Idiots is the best film this festive period, he told me it takes an idiot to be able to tell one, and that I saw myself in the film. If anything, I'll take that as a compliment, as the film is about self-actualization, or the simple fact that it's a wake up call in this rat race of a world that we live in, that we lose sight of things that matter in the pursuit of success. It's a wake up call that we should be pursuing Excellence instead, which in the work environment one gets easily drowned in mediocrity, or blind faith that success follows without putting in too much hard work.Set predominantly in the varsity days and told in chunks of flashback, this film will allow you to reminisce about a time where life was nothing but exams, lectures, and that paper chase, either making the grade or having to repeat. But there's also probably that one person, or a few if you're lucky, whom you'll meet on campus that will help you directly or indirectly, shape your outlook, thinking and just about forming long lasting bonds, whose interaction with will shape your character just before entering the workforce.3 Idiots tell of such a friendship, amongst 3 buddies Farhan (R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi), two mediocre students who just scrape through, and the one huge influence in their lives, ace student Rancho (Aamir Khan), the livewire of the trio who irks the Dean of Imperial College of Engineering (modelled after the famed Indian Institute of Technology), Professor Viru (Virus), played by Boman Irani. In fact, it's something like a Hindi equivalent of the local I Not Stupid with its critique on the educational system, but done with a lot more finesse, fun and without sledgehammering its ideals down your throat.The gist of the disparity here is the concept of learning how to learn, or teaching somebody how to fish compared to just giving the students the fish. It's a reminder that knowledge gathering goes beyond just doing so for exams, and the techniques of blindly cramming will do one not much good later on. It's about the application of knowledge for the real world than to answer papers, and the joy of acquiring such knowledge. It's the 3 Idiots versus the Professor, and their peer Chatur ""Silencer"" (Omi Vaidya who played the role with glee, as the peer bootlicker that everyone loves to hate) who throws down the gauntlet to Rancho as to who will eventually be the more successful of the lot.What made 3 Idiots work remarkably, is the excellent chemistry between the leads. Aamir Khan, the big name as he is, doesn't upstage his co-stars R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi, as their characters get into various forms of shenanigans in college. Instead they complement one another in their roles, and thanks to makeup, look very much comfortable as their aged selves, and their younger teenage ones through closely cropped hair, and outfits. Aamir aces the role of Rancho as the boy who gets ahead of the pack without really trying and at times being perceived as both the smarty pants and the troublemaker of his cohort, though his sudden disappearance after graduation has made his good friends try to track him down, albeit unsuccessfully. The film also doesn't take itself too seriously when the time calls for it, switching quite playfully to ramp up its funny moments, even at times breaking the fourth wall when telling the story of Raju's background (in black and white melodrama no less). The jokes here worked wonders as well, as do the couple of twists that roll along in the 2nd act after the interval, which is somewhat telling of the narrative depth that the film possessed. Songs were breezy and plenty of fun, and I personally enjoyed Aal Izz Well (All Is Well) best, a chant that the Idiots adopted from Rancho, who uses it to calm his heart when it's filled with anxiety and fear. I think it works.Affairs of the heart though are kept at a bare minimum, when Rancho falls for the daughter of Professor Viru, Pia (Kareena Kapoor). While they start off in quite testy terms, things start to thaw when Pia sees Rancho for who he is, except that the secret Rancho keeps threatens to keep them permanently apart. And that is unless the other 2 pals could help it in their quest to locate Rancho. Everything falls into place at the end, especially telling of the second act when you learn of this secret at the cliffhanger prior to the interval, and this provides yet another emotional sucker punch to your gut when themes like friendship lasting forever starts entering the picture.Chase excellence and success will follow; this film lived up to that tagline in being one of the most excellent I've watched this year. Amongst all the film offerings put out this festive season, my choice for the most uplifting, the most hopeful and a jolly entertaining ride all around with elements of everything only a Bollywood film is renowned for, is this one. Don't miss it, and it goes directly, albeit a late entry, as a contender for my top films of the year!"
I never thought I could love a three-hour comedy,18 January 2022,10.0,"By now, I've seen at least 80 Bollywood films, largely thanks to Netflix and Covid. I'm still not used to the extra 30-45 minutes they tend to run compared to analogous Western productions. Longer comedies test my patience more than the action flicks. That's not a cultural gap. I've complained many times about Judd Apatow's excessive footage diluting the enjoyment his casting and material could have delivered in a tighter package.This delightful film transcends all norms. It's so well-written and performed that the time flew. The mix of savvy and silly adds up to a joyful package. The smattering of musical numbers kept the fun going somewhat more smoothly than has often been the case. The early conflicts hilariously established characters, setting up the rest. Several moments elicited more tears than I would have wanted others to see leaking from my orbs. The script builds to several terrific callbacks. I'm glad I checked IMDb's Top 250 list and decided to work my way through most of the dozen or two I'd missed. This one truly deserves its place among them."
Clearly the best Hindi movie of 2009.. must watch,30 December 2009,9.0,"I watched '3 idiots' on the Christmas Day. Being an Aamir Khan fan the expectations were huge. The movie is excellent, absolutely fun filled and hilarious but deviates from its main idea of Education system after the intermission. The depiction of education system of India is completely true where each and every prof. is interested only in the fact that you have mugged up his lessons on not. Being an IITian myself I can assure you of this. Aamir Khan is awesome, Sharman and Madhavan are also good as usual. Boman Irani rocks again with his stand out performance. Kareena Kapoor is OK considering her not so important role. The stand out scene of this movie is clearly Omi's 'Balatkaar' speech.But considering Raju Hirani previous works, this movie can't be called his best. Its like Hirani hit a double hundred in his 1st one(Munnabhai MBBS), a 50-60 in his 2nd and a 90* in this.Considering all these, I would go with an 7 out of a 10 and thumbs up for this movie. You can surely spend two hundred bucks, it is worth it."
An undeniable masterpiece,29 June 2013,9.0,"One of my students - a girl, once asked me how would she know if she has found the right guy. I told her I don't know how but I shared with her a method to sieve out the useless ones. Get them to watch 2 films with you and watch for their reactions. If the first reaction is ""I don't watch silly Japanese cartoons and musical Hindi flicks,"" discard them like used tissue papers because they are not worth your time. Why?  Because they already have deep-set perceived ideas and worse of all, they will not even give it a chance, not even for you. Then if they do want to watch them, watch for their reactions. If they give snide and self-important remarks, hello-goodbye them out of your life. The 2 movies that I suggested to her were My Neighbour Totoro and 3 Idiots. I saw 3 Idiots again today and I am surprised it's only my second time. But it feels like only just yesterday that I got to know the 3 musketeers - Farhan, Raju and Rancho. I think that's one of the reason why it's so successful - their easy chemistry.  The 3 characters' arcs are so divisive (each focusing on different aspects of the pursuit of education) but yet so intertwined because of their deep friendship. At the end, I remember walking out of the cinema learning life lessons from a master. This time round watching it at home, I realize why I love it so much. Most films only have one central theme and all the plot revolves around that. 3 Idiots has bigger aspirations - it was deftly balancing multiple themes. It didn't only delve on aspects of education, it also hit on subjects like superficiality, parenting, treating people right etc.  In my opinion, one of the reasons why the film succeeds is that it wasn't preachy. It didn't need 10 minutes to force the schmaltz down your throat, it just throws the idea out there and it hits home. Take a look at Jack Neo's I'm Not Stupid, same big subject but you will vomit out all the top-down schmaltz by the end of the movie. I think 3 Idiots realizes that these ideas for living your life and the pursuit of excellence are in all of our consciousness... We all know them but we just never act against them and allowed it to permeate our lives from way back.  The film only needs to throw out the ideas, package them in a fresh approach and it hits the home run. None of the ideas needed to linger longer than it was necessary. I love the narrative structure which is actually a road movie.  Most directors will just do tough love in a linear manner. 3 Idiots uses flashback very effectively. If you think about it, we are only seeing Farhan's version of Rancho for 95% of the film. How do we know that's the real version? The real Rancho only appears right at the end.  The use of screwball comedy works remarkably well too. In fact, the tone switches like the mind of an idiot suffering from a tri-polar complex. For instance, in the ending of the second act, the birthing of Mona's baby in the midst of the biggest flood and rain. I loathe these birthing scenes in movies. Always feel like some fake big life affirming moment but seeing how it is handled here I am so awed. Not pretentious and look at how the tone switches like crazy - from sad (expulsion from ICE), to tension (no transport to the hospital and no electricity), to full-on problem solving (the theme of what education is for culminates here), to comedy, to celebration, back to total sadness again ('death' of baby) and to the closing metaphor of ""All Izz Well"". Freaking brilliant. It was then I realized the director builds up the ""All Izz Well"" metaphor all through the film until that point. And it didn't end there. That last speech by the professor to Rancho in the driving rain closed up, no, bookended what actually began in their first meeting where Rancho asks why didn't the astronauts use a pencil in space. This is what CLASS is about and this film has truckloads of it. The only misstep for me is the romance angle between Pia and Rancho wasn't totally satisfying. Their cute meet is really awesome but if Pia has learned anything from Rancho, why would she still want to marry Mr Pricetag in the end?  I know it was just a narrative ploy to get all the parties together for the final journey to meet Rancho but it didn't feel right for me.  But really, I am just nitpicking. I apologize if I let out some spoilers but seriously if you have not seen this, you must be the type of person that I mentioned about in the first paragraph."
Easily one of the most overrated films on IMDb,26 February 2016,6.0,"The script is the biggest problem with this film. It is filled with clichés and unoriginal jokes. The theme and message of the film is spelled out for the audience a million times. It should be more subtle and realistic. The sequence of events is entirely predictable.Additionally, there is nothing exceptional about any other element of the film in my opinion. There is nothing impressive about the camera work. There is nothing impressive about set design or costume design. There is nothing impressive about the acting or characterization.It is emotionally manipulative using every trick in the book and there is nothing to enjoy if you do not fall for that. How it is so far up IMDb's top 250 is beyond me."
Very long and heartwarming,1 June 2020,6.0,"I'm not familiar with Indian films so this was a good introduction. The characters are funny, if one-dimensional, and the storyline is heartfelt. There is some satire of education and society that I can get behind."
amazing movies,29 December 2009,10.0,"I absolutely LOVED this movie. I was one of two or three 'white' people in the Cinema, and waiting in the line i got a lot of 'looks', but I'm speechless to how good this movie was!!! Aamir just keeps getting better!!!! TZP was amazing, Ghajani was amazing and now 3 Idiots... AMAZING!!! cant wait to own it on DVD!!! I might even go see it again at the cinema!! I've now seen about 5 Bollywood movies at the cinema, and i own about 30 movies on DVD. I'm an Aussie what LOVES Bollywood & Aamir Khan!!! What movies is next for Aamir? I'm sure it will be another to touch our hearts, i'd love to see his body ripped like in Ghajani again! 3 IDIOTS ROCKS!!!"
Significant and entertaining,10 December 2020,10.0,"This is a significant Bollywood movie, but for European or American viewers, it is best compared to a binge-watched colorful Hollywood miniseries by style, melodramatic and light in tone, but much more filled with meaning. It celebrates Gypsy style music and ingenuity in poverty while criticizing strict education systems of high Asiatic pressure and parental authority which stifles creativity by senseless rot-learning even at top institutions. Quite entertaining and watchable, and different in style - but not at all inferior in quality - to the top Hollywood production, it has some authentic light humorous touches and some intense melodrama - an over the top Bollywood type soap opera that is somewhat a significant social critique at the same time."
The most fun I have ever had watching a movie!,13 April 2011,6.0,"3 idiots offers a great deal of fun. Indeed, one of the best movies I have ever seen! Its experience is simple, yet it's great in every aspect! I absolutely loved the fact that this film had it all, wonderful atmosphere, brilliant acting, lovely inspiring songs and a surprisingly thrilling story! During the movie, I laughed and cried A LOT!! The combination of the movie aspects was astonishing. I never thought I would enjoy an Indian movie as much as I enjoyed Slumdog Millionaire, but this one simply surpasses every other Indian movie. The story is touching, inspiring and funny.. at the same time!! This movie is plain FUN. It's about family, friendship and a little bit of romance. It had a great deal of great family moments that are still stuck in my mind till now (I saw the movie a week ago!) Plus it deals with friendship and its impacts on a person's life, and what a brilliant friendship story we saw in this movie! One of the greatest friendship stories captured on cinema mixed joyously with top-notch fun. I recommend this movie to anyone who actually wants to enjoy a real movie experience that has it all, in other words.. this movie is recommended for EVERYONE! Acting: 10, Direction: 9, Soundtrack: 10, Story: 10, Overall rating: A decent 10!Don't just rent it, OWN it and show it to friends who like to enjoy a fun movie!"
my take on the film 3 idiots,6 June 2013,6.0,"3 idiots i a great film, that portrays 3 boys in college and the funny antics they get up to while in this process. The film shows how learning can be made fun, and as long as you love what you do, you will succeed in it. but the film isn't all fun and games, the movie portrays the flaws that India currently have in their educational system, it also shows that not everyone can do what they love as the pressure put upon them by their families can be an argument to persuade anyone, the movie shows a suicide, this really shocks the viewers, and the fact is that the film isn't a fictional one and when a person fails, they do commit suicide, I'm not saying all do but quite a few. They also show the hypocrisy of class and how though everyone thought the main character was a wealthy heir he was no more than a servant posing for the heir who could not even understand engineering. The birth of the headmasters grandchild makes the viewer see that the educational system can change, along with the people running it, and the stereotype of a woman being a doctor and a man becoming an engineer becomes to deteriorate. All in all a great film, and worthy for its position in the top 250 films"
A really fun and enlightening movie,16 January 2013,3.0,"I've decided to start this review by describing what happened during the screening of this movie in one of my University class to demonstrate just how interesting this movie really is.Our lecturer has decided to replace one of our classes on a weeknight and during the class, he has decided to show us this movie. The class started at 8 p.m. and as my class consist of students who are used to skipping classes (even the afternoon ones) or are prone to leaving early (including myself), I was expecting the class to be almost empty by the end of it.By the end of the class, which was about 11.30 p.m., none of the students actually left the lecture hall because everyone really enjoy the movie so much and all of us wanted to finish the movie because it was fun, interesting and inspiring.The movie has tackled an important aspect in the modern society: Why do we study ? Is it only for the sake of getting a well-paid job in the future ? Or was it for the knowledge or interest ? This movie had us questioning our purpose of studying and whether we are doing it for the sake of our future job, to fulfill our parents' demands and expectation or to feed our hunger for knowledge ?All of us go to school for a different reason, some to make friends or to hang out with their friends, there are some who really enjoys learning new things everyday but many are those who go to school just for the sake of completing their studies.The movie tries to bring out this point through humor, loads of them ! The movie is really funny and through unfolding the events by looking into the past and present, it avoids being too straight forward which in my opinion, keeps the audience interested in the movie without getting bored.I really love the movie and has always recommended people to watch it, in fact, everyone that I know who have watched the movie loved it. This movie is really one of my favorite movies of all time."
"It is NOT a great movie, it IS a good movie though",24 December 2009,3.0,"OK so just to make it clear, I do think this movie is very funny! As a matter of fact, its hilarious. My only problem with the movie is ---1) Unoriginal - I understand that the original concept was developed by Mr Hirani himself, but nonetheless, its not fresh. Might as well call it ""Munnabhai BSc - THE DEJA VU"". I guess since the west has the 3 stooges, and 3 musketeers, we need something too right? 2) Old Jokes - the common urban legend of spending millions of dollars on a space pen instead of using a pencil, and ""how does a motor start"", and the fact that indians only want their children to be engineers or doctors (we do have actors, cricketers, and politicians, don't we?), just too old. 3) Unrealistic - I don't even feel the need to explain this one. (I think Bollywood directors firmly believe in an old adage- ""Everything is possible"" and they follow it religiously in every movie. Be it bringing a dead to life by saying ""AAL IZZ WELL"" or stopping a wedding at the last second (how does this not get boring, i can name 10 movies that have already done this and i don't even watch too many bollywood movies) on a bright note, it is very funny (yes the jokes are old, but they are executed pretty well), please watch it and i apologize for being such a hater. I am just giving my 2 cents. Plus, I think everyone did a great job in the movie. I laughed my ass off on few occasions, but so did I while watching American Pie...and so I strongly disagree with those who think this movie is a masterpiece. it is not. 6.5/10."
The Fun Side of Bollywood,10 January 2014,8.0,"There was an article published by Time magazine some years ago. It explained that while China enjoys a robust population and a rigorous educational system (for those who can afford it), the spontaneous and creative aspects of Chinese culture has been subverted. It's been marginalized so much so that American business specialists have been asked to speak at some of china's most prestigious companies to ""teach"" creativity. The article presumes that Chinese middle-managers have had so many concepts and facts drilled into them in school that they are unable to think outside of the box like Americans.Subtle racism and cold war paranoia aside, the article does have a point when it comes to the importance of academic memorization versus creativity. American public schools have been drawing and redrawing that line trying to find the right balance to mold the leaders of tomorrow with mixed results. Yet when I hear stories of a fifteen year old inventing a new groundbreaking cancer test, I can't help but feel a little prideful of being the partial product of American schooling.But while the Chinese seem to be stumbling, India has really stepped up, or at least the film 3 Idiots (2009) would have you believe it. Starring Aamir Khan as the amiable Rancho, the plot of 3 Idiots sounds like a Van Wilder (2002) rip-off. The brilliant but unorthodox Rancho causes mayhem and silliness at an uptight engineering university. His two friends Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) join in the revelry to the dismay of the pig-headed dean known to the students as Virus (Boman Irani). But when Rancho takes interest in the dean's daughter played by Kareena Kapoor, the dean vows to have the 3 idiots expelled for good.Bollywood films are very good at taking seemingly trivial plots like the aforesaid and escalating them into gorgeous, high energy, thematically complex tales for which 3 Idiots is no exception. The movie encompasses a vastness of emotion and a breadth of themes which I do not dare expand on here for fear of ruining the movie. I will say that 3 Idiots does further validate my hypothesis that a major theme in modern Bollywood is upward mobility. While my familiarity with Indian film is limited, all the films I have seen made over the past twenty years involve a protagonist unhappy with his or her station in life and works their butt off to achieve better, often through creative means.I saw this theme in the repellently named Wedding Planners aka Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and the silly sci-fi comedy Joker (2012). Even the sappy love musicals of Yash Chopra like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) have characters who want to do better largely by questioning the conventions of traditional ways. 3 Idiots is an extension of that proud tradition only done with excellent comedy and some surprisingly depth along with some catchy musical numbers.Stop to consider today's modern American films in comparison. Sure there are classic hero journeys in movie theaters but few have unadulterated happy endings quite like Bollywood. Many settle for the moral of ""do what you can,"" or ""you can be happy with your lot in life so long as you have someone to love"". And let's not forget the common contemporary comedy message ""have fun and worry about the consequences later."" These messages make sense in the economic malaise of the day and the superhero genre has replaced the musical comedy as far as being a glitzy distraction for the masses. Still the superhero films as well as the Oscar-bait of the last few years don't have the subversive themes of their Indian counterparts. Nor to they have the energy! The energy in 3 Idiots is so incredibly infectious, if you're not smiling in the first five minutes you might need defibrillation. Seriously call a doctor, you're legally dead.Those who are worried about China's looming domination of Asia and eventual world power status need not worry about it. If I were worried about any country flexing its muscle it'd be India. It's a polyglot, multicultural nation with English its language of commerce. It's got a huge, pro-democratic population and has the creative juices to pull off long-term economic and cultural growth. But don't lose any sleep over the decline of the American Empire, at least our overlords will be benevolent or at the very least hilarious.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"
Absolutely loved it.,14 July 2011,8.0,"I checked this out on a whim from my library and was so impressed that I just had to come here to review it. Please note I am NOT Indian, but this is (as of yesterday) one of my top five favorite films of all time. My only criticism is the title - it's horribly misleading for American audiences who would probably expect a Judd Apatow nonsense film (and offensive to boot). Not so with this film - the characters are anything but idiots despite their college experiences. Brilliantly written and directed, there's something for everyone here: comedy, tragedy, and even a couple of song and dance numbers (seamlessly integrated). The acting is superb, the plot is a bit complex but fascinating, and it's shot with care and attention. LOVE IT."
"An ""oeuvre d'art""",13 November 2011,10.0,"For starters, every cinephile must watch this movie, it's absolutely mandatory!!!! The movie has great story line, rich in its roots, evolves naturally, showing beautiful landscapes of India. All characters are so dense, so real, so credible, despite of being caricatured....there is a lot of marvelous interactions between them all way down the story...and their interaction onto scenarios are great and constant...that's one thing I could notice it made the movie such a strong production.... The film is funny, genius, superb, surprising, fading from touching moments to challenging scenes, so naturally...... Reamrkable photography as well. It's one of the most exciting movies I've ever seen - is deep, enjoyable and, ultimately, leaves a lesson about what is really important in life.... I recommend the family watch this movies, together...is outrageous!!! It mention taboos, the everyday's strive of families, hopes, dreams, disappointing, love, envy, debauch, etc.... And all this magic moment, start with an aborted airplane take-off......"
This movie is really meaningful to us Asians,26 October 2013,10.0,"The very fact that the education system in my country (and perhaps in a lot of developing countries) SUCKS and as a student, I am seriously suffering from it, makes this movie worth watching. It gives me a little hope, a little faith, that success and happiness will eventually come to those who pursue excellence in stead of just focusing on their grades, their qualifications. I guess that many Western people cannot understand what Asian students like me are going through. We have to study all day, I mean, studying is not only a 7 to 5 ""job"" but it also deprive us of our sleep. The working environment is so damn competitive, our parents are like 'get straight A's or you will have nothing to eat' and the stress is unbearable. So, if you are having to deal with all these, give this movie a try! Good laughs, great messages, enjoyable story."
"""Aal izz well"" with the 3 Idiots!",27 December 2009,10.0,"Chetan Bhagat's ""Five Point Someone"" may not be called a literary masterpiece, but it sure is entertaining with its guffaws and its Indianized English. I read the book a while back, and I was highly impressed by the author's straightforward and vitriolic views about the sagacious education system. Bhagat had introduced Ryan Oberoi to play the role of the rebel, an anarchist who wanted to do away with the grumpy system of education prevailing in India. Ryan was never his protagonist; he simply played the second fiddle in the book. It was Hari, the mundane narrator of the book who was the hero. But things turned topsy-turvy when Bollywood walked into the scene to dramatize the already dramatic story of Five Point Someone. And then when in the book everything went happily ever after with the three idiots, namely Ryan, Hari, and Alok, Bollywood begot its own idiots Farhaan (R. Madhavan), Raju (Sharmaan Joshi) and Rancho (Aamir Khan)the great for its new cinematic endeavor 3 Idiots .3 Idiots can be summed up in one word as extremely majestic. It surely will make you laugh your guts out with its slapstick jokes, its funny sequences, its bathetically emotional scenes and make you to shed a tear or two in the emotional sequences. In short, 3 Idiots is a perfect desi dinner for your bulbous eyes which has all the spices in almost perfect proportion. The genetically modified melodrama has all it takes to hit the Indian audiences hard, and I see it topping the charts in no time. The movie definitely followed a major part of the book, only the incidents were either jumbled or heightened for greater effect.3 Idiot' is a laughter riot right from the first scene where Farhaan fakes a heart attack while onboard an Air India flight to the last scene where Chatur finds out that his role model Mr. Phunsuk Wangdu is none but his college rival Rancho. I especially loved the portrayal of Raju's glum family in black and white. Despite scenes of hilarity, 3 Idiots does suffer from backlogs of vague emotions which seem at some portions of the movie vaguely put on, unorganized and unneeded. Another thing that stuck me was the heroic character of Rancho. I know it doesn't look good for the perfect image of a movie if its hero fails to live up to the standard and flunks in exams or scores 5 point something, so Bollywood made Ryan Oberoi (of the book) alias Rancho become the class topper thus bringing forth the idea that we cannot still accept a flawed hero in our movies. In the long run, the act actually exemplified the character of Rancho and brought out the real essence of the movie. But the child delivery scene in the movie was definitely overtly exaggerated. I don't think Chetan Bhagat has ever imagined his Ryan to do a child delivery with the aid of his friends. Since everything is fair in Bollywood and war, such sacrileges add to the vivacity of the movie's plot.3 Idiots is a star studded affair which presents us with the grand acting skills of stars like Boman Irani as Professor.Viru Sahastrabuddhe or Omi Vaidya as Chatur Ramalingam. But Kareena Kapoor seemed a little unwanted as Pia, she didn't add to the character of the fashion designing student Neha of the book, instead she is here a smart would be doctor who falls for the charm of Rancho out of the blue. One thing that stuck me about the movie is the way the real ages of the stars have been camouflaged fruitlessly. Even though Aamir Khan is a perfectionist as an actor, he seemed a little too old to be an engineering student in his early twenties. Nevertheless, the movie is a first hand example of great filmatography and fabulous humor. Like all Rajkumar Hirani' movie, this one has treats for all its viewers. The peppy song ""Aal izz well"" reminds us of his Munna Bhai movies.The dialogues used in the movie will definitely come as eye openers to brainless muggers. 3 Idiots deftly bring out the very quintessence of Five Point Someone bringing to light the fatal flaws of the Indian education system. And though at some point Aamir Khan does look like a know-it-all holy spirit inculcating others with his words, he does reciprocate Chetan Bhagat's ideas that the Indian education system lacks creativity and spontaneous love for knowledge. I hope Aamir's words reach the generation next and come as a harbinger of a utopian vision of a new educational system in India. Movies with messages such as this one should be taken as ground breaking attempts to change society.The movie is an absolute delight when it comes to music. It features a galaxy of beautiful songs shot in great locations. I personally loved ""Behti hawa"" and ""Zoobie doobie"". Overall, 3 Idiots is a wonderfully heartwarming movie that teaches us to stop being mentally troglodytes and introduce creativity in our minds."
A Bollywood for everybody,29 February 2016,7.0,"Dear hypocrites: If ""Amelie"" and ""Forrest Gump"" can be mainstays of the top 250, so can ""3 Idiots"" - a movie that similarly gets away with a lot of silliness because it's truly endearing and has an unbeatable joie de vivre. It also features a genuinely uplifting message that only hardboiled cynics will fail to appreciate.Yes, it's probably 45 minutes too long, but on the flip side: the songs are fun, the directing is dynamic, and Aamir Khan pulls out his best Indian Tom Hanks performance. Also, unless you're xenophobic, it's fascinating to see love, dreams and life from an Indian perspective.If you want to see one Bollywood movie before you die, make it this one. It will make you feel better."
"Touching story of friendship, drama and adventure from Bollywood!",7 July 2014,7.0,"I first watched this movie while on vacation, staying at my aunt and uncle's house. As this was the movie they chose to watch one night, I was preparing to drag myself to endure a painfully long, three-hour drama. However, I've found it to be very engaging and entertaining.In this film, Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi want to re-unite with college friend Rancho and recounted their college days at New Delhi's Imperial College of Engineering, recalling the memories of Rancho, who inspired them to think differently, their run-ins with the fiery college dean Viru Sahastrabudhe and their encounters with another student, Chatur Ramalingam, who reminds them of a bet they had made 10 years ago.This is the first and only Bollywood movie I have seen and while I am not a big fan of drama, Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijit Joshi wrote a very inspiring story for the film that kept me entertained, covering friendship, sacrifices, relationships, antics, secrets, rivalries and struggles in the movie. Hirani took good care making each scene of the movie captivating and intriguing while directing, keeping the plot's momentum going strong even for a three-hour movie, and assembled a likable cast of characters - each delivering solid performances.I enjoyed watching the antics and misadventures the three friends go through during their college days, fumbling through exam notes and cramming in science projects, striving to reach success. Rancho's little romantic relationship with Pia is also a treat to watch, ***minor spoiler ahead*** especially when, unbeknown-st to Rancho, that she is the daughter of the dean. ***minor spoiler ends*** The songs sung in the film is wonderful to listen to - very catchy and fun - and the cinematography is very vibrant and colorful.Overall, it is a very captivating and heartfelt film from start to finish, sure to bring you laughter and tears. You can't help but follow along and pretend you are there with the three friends' journey in life. A highly recommended movie! Grade A"
Reality Check for you,10 January 2013,9.0,"Being an Indian I have seen a lot of Bollywood movies which do not live upto international standards. 3 Idiots is no different. It's a masala movie, which will draw only mainstream and dumb folk. It might be attractive to the viewers outside as such experiences are new to them, however the truth is that this movie doesn't deserve any place in any top lists on IMDb. I'm sure that the people who have given it a 10/10 have never seen any other movie on the top 250 list. It was a major hit in Indian theatres and any rational,logical and a real movie buff can never like this sort of an impractical movie. To be honest, for an Indian movie I'd give it a 6/10 , however on an international scale it would barely get a 5. If you want to watch a good Indian movie, I'd recommend watching Dev.D which I rate as an 8/10; and I feel should be on the top 250 list. Make a wise decision"
Marvelous movie,19 July 2013,9.0,"first thing I want to thank and of course congratulate all the person who became part of this sensational movie , it was really a heart-piercing movie :) It made me cried honestly :) . And after I watched this movie I really admired and idolized Aamir Khan :) my best ACTOR and of course the my BEST IDOL ever ! :) . This movie also inspired me most and I was able to apply the learning in my daily living , It was an enlightenment for me in terms of importance of friendship and family in my life ;) and of course I too as a person . Lets continue supporting Bollywood movies :) as well as Aamir Khan. ! Thank YOU!"
Funny*25000000,2 December 2015,6.0,"I have heard about the movie since its first release in China, but my friends always despise Bollywood movies because their style is not original. But 3 idiots is intriguing enough to shatter my bias. Character building is successful enough to make the three idiots, Pia, Virus and even Chatur seems authentic and attractive to me. I love the bright, joyful color of a school comedy that lightens up the mood before the characters even appears. Twists and turns in this movie is so cleverly arranged that the excitement they creates are perfectly maintained by the next. Rancho, the legendary guy, happens to leak his whereabouts when Chatur declares victory over the other 2 idiots, and they happen to seize the opportunity to make the real Rancho spill the shameful truth, and Pia happens to get married at the same day, so they can restore the poetic justice for Rancho/Wangdo and embrace the perfect ending. Along with the genius student character that challenge the virus and seniors and get away with it, the audience's expectation for this older Rancho climbs to the peak when the car reaches his school, so that the final enlightenment of his true identity push the satisfaction to a climax. The screenplay writer must be a genius.Actors for the the main roles are also outstanding. There lively expression break the leash of staid Indian faces in our perception. Also I was a little disappointed by the first appearance of Rancho, this extraordinary actor present the image of a genius student and a successful scientist. The one point that touches me the most is their tears, which cooperate with their sincere glittering eyes and pretty smiles. Every time when I am about to leap out of the drama because of the ""I will stay here until your dad gets well""cliché, I am pulled back by their facial expressions. Pia is beautiful and attractive all right, also I don't understand why she attempted to married the price tag after dumping him once. Is it really that important for a Indian woman to get married? Virus is ugly and ridiculous with his huge big belly, I started to like him after he offered Rancho his pen unwillingly after he saved his daughter. He was an ossified elitism asshole until I detected his unyielding love for Mona and his deceased son.After all, it's a brilliant piece. Love it, 8 stars"
Unexpected,25 January 2016,6.0,"Finding this movie and checking out the ratings, I was left a bit confused and wondering whether or not they came from all the Indians watching it. As it turns out, they didn't. This was an amazing movie, a movie that tackles more than one topics but focuses on the anxiety of young people studying, wondering what they are going to do with their lives. This is a global phenomenon and this is a great movie to watch early in your lifetime. I am not 20 or so, but it still taught me a thing or two and allowed me to objectively assess my situation in my work. I loved it. Humor is there in large doses, the scenery and landscapes are amazing and the movie is optimistic but also realistic at points. There are moments in the movie when you're laughing and in an instant you may find yourself crying. It was long but justified to be and it was never tiring, not at any point during the film. The actors were just brilliant and I think that this is one of the finest movies on Indian culture I have ever seen. If you also managed to miss it as I did, when it came out, now's the time to look for it and rent it. It's a must!"
GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE IN THE WORLD,10 July 2021,1.0,"THIS MOVIE WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH,CRY,ANGRY & WILL INSPIRE YOU AT THE SAME TIME. RANCHO,RAJU & FARHAN IS THE BEST TRIO I'VE SEEN IN INDIAN CINEMA. EVERY DIALOGUE IN THE MOVIE WILL INSPIRE YOU & TEACH YOU SOMETHING. THE FUNNY SCENES TOO WILL TEACH YOU MANY THINGS. A PERFECTLY MADE MASTERPIECE. FOR ME IT IS AN EPITOME OF PERFECTION & BEAUTY. RAJKUMAR HIRANI'S PERSPECTIVE IS DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER DIRECTOR'S I'VE EVER SEEN. HE CAN MAKE YOU LAUGH,CRY & INSPIRE YOU AT THE SAME TIME. NO WORDS WILL BE ENOUGH TO TELL YOU HOW BEAUTIFUL A MOVIE IT IS. PLEASE WATCH IT ONCE BEFORE YOU DIE.(100/100)"
3 Idoits! :),2 April 2012,1.0,"I thought I was going to see some Bollywood version of ""American Pie"" or something. But this is truly a fantastic, thoughtful, well-made film! But this film's title will mislead a lot of people thinking this is some mindless teen flick. I will do my best and recommend everyone I know to see it!Very nice songs in the film. Zoobi Doobi and All is well. Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Boman Irani are very successful. My favorite player in the serious Aamir Khan!My favorite player in the character Raju because he is a very intelligent person.Great movie! Definitely see it."
A perfect move,5 June 2021,10.0,"If I could give this movie 100 out of 10, I would do it."
Very Funny And One Of The Best Comedies I Have Ever Seen !!,27 August 2013,10.0,"First of all, This is the first time for me watching an Indian movie. This film isn't over rated at all. It's very entertaining and amusing. The whole cast was great every actor played his character very well specially (Boman Irani) and (Aamir Khan) for being 44 years old and performing a younger character with almost no changes in age. This movie is awesome not because of one actor or a couple of actors, it is a joint effort of every member of this movie. The director was good for assigning these actors to play those characters, and the music was good. This was my first time to watch an Indian movie and it's not going to be the last. I recommend it for those who love comedies and they will not be disappointed."
The True Gem of Bollywood. Even Hollywood can't replace it.,6 August 2021,10.0,"If you want enjoy comedy, romance, friendship, social problem and its solution packed in one movie. Watch this Masterpiece.I watched this movie so many time but Everytime I see it, it becomes more and more enjoyable.Aamir Khan is perhaps the greatest gift of God to Bollywood who gave it some of the greatest masterpieces no one can't remake.Rajkumar Hirani's perfect direction, wonderful performances by Aamir Khan, Boman Irani and Kareena kapoor, and the final message of the movie makes it the 'GREATEST MOVIE OF THE CENTURY SO FAR'."
Masterpiece from Bollywood,17 January 2023,10.0,"Masterpiece from Bollywood, All is well, as they so often say. Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots, my introduction to the world of Bollywood cinema, is a comedy-drama unlike anyone I've ever seen, long, but never drawn out, frantic, but never desperate, and emotional, but never manipulating. It provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade, and with insight to the culture of Indians and their parents. Rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind, while possessing a title not even fit for a farce. 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief."
Absolute Master,15 December 2021,8.0,"Frstly Take a Bow HIRANI Ji.Everything is great in this movie , No Flaws through out the film. Entertaining and thought provoking at same time.Acting of amir khan, Boman , madhavan, Joshi and of other actors are top natch. Everybody nailed it.Direction wise , hirani is most humorous i have ever seen. He delivered what he wanted in picture perfect manner.Must Watch for every Educated Guy/."
"unforgettable, inspirational, a must watch",6 January 2015,8.0,"The first time I watched this film it was a great surprise, because I've never liked Bollywood films and I didn't know what to expect. A friend of mine told me that it was her favorite film and that I should watch it..I'm glad that I've listened to her.This marvelous film is so good that you don't even notice the long duration of it. It has a little bit of everything and even the few musical parts of the movie fits perfectly.Directed with a perfect rhythm, this movie rebels against the actual educational system in which the more important is to pass tests but not really achieving new skills than really learns something that is going to be useful.Rancho, the main character of the film, is introduced to the audience as an idealist who defies the system not caring about the consequences, his one and only concern is study hard for learning and achieve new skills. An amazing character that should inspire who watches the film.Definitely this movie is not what it looks at first sight, it is a great, unforgettable and inspirational film that gets into the bottom of the heart."
Fantabulous Indian cinema - Slow to digest but overall great appeal,24 December 2009,9.0,"Well, to start with, lemme clarify, I have a knack of bringing down bollywood cinema being a puritanical movie critic. And the only reason I still hold on to Indian Cinema is Aamir khan. His movies have been the cornerstone of generational behavior through the decades. Indians have experiences the best of reelistic emotions, vigor, love, comedy through the works of Aamir. He defines a supreme talent with an eye for every detail that could connect with the audience in the lightest and most deepest of senses. You will never know what hits you when you watch some of his best works.Moving forward, I went to see 3 idiots with the same expectations from an Aamir movie. Starting with the storyline, it was pretty well presented and starting was glitchy which was readily made up by Aamir's presence, which obviously was staged as such but does make a nice impact. His two sideburns namely Sharman and Maddy did a superb job in their own respective way and special mention to Maddy for his subtle way of bringing the best out of a sidekick role. Another special mention goes to a character names Chatur (dunno the real name) for adding superb comic zing to the movie. Gals were passé but were essential. Some of the scenes were long dragged and kinda unnecessary songs as such a repertoire of bollywood, nevertheless, weighing pros against cons which anyways outnumber the cons, I would like to assure the kind of essence movie brings out as a whole is meaningful and thematic in the most lighthearted and fun filled way.Some of the hilarious scenes were so funny that my friend mentioned it to be the best comic scene in Indians cinema. People might point it out as gross or amateurish but it does forms an essential part of college humor which still is gibberish and kindergarten grade compared to western comedies. Aamir does a fantastic job again maybe not that much as the role he portrays but as an overall feel he brings to any movie he forms a part of. Hirani does bring lot of experiences from his part ventures into this movie but they are well figured out and I must admit, he does belong to the best breed of directors in Indian cinema's current generation with the likes of Imtiaz Ali, Vishal Bhardwaj and Prakash jha, masters in their own genre.Overall movie does give you a fantastic feel as you walk out of the theater and is a perfect gift from Aamir to everyone for Christmas. A must watch for Indian cinema buffs and indeed figures as one of the best recent movies with no award winning stuff but just for the flow it controls the psyche of the audience and brings them through all simple emotions with laughter and grit.3.5/5"
"3 Idiots: Chetan Bhagat, Raju Hirani and Us",1 January 2010,9.0,"3 Idiots 6/10Rating it more than that is an insult to other good movies.Warning: If u've read the book which it claims to be inspired of, u'll be highly disappointed. The movie is so much diff. than book.Angst: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I could not find a single line giving credits to Chetan Bhagat for the idea at least.Question: Remember Taare Zamin Par? Now take Ishan Awasti from it, make him older enough to get into a college and make Amir Khan play the character, what do u get?? We get Taare Zamin Part-2 or 3 Idiots.This movie is a mix of Munnabhai MBBS and Taare Zamin Par (Painting vs. Photography; as if there is only one creative work in this world). Even the dialogs sound similar to Taare Zamin Par. I ask, what is the point in shouting same issue over and over, what is the point in proving same point everyday.Let me tell u, 3-Idiots has nothing new to deliver. This movie wanted to be in Munnabhai league but failed miserably. It lacks the fine tuning, light hearted situational comedy with subtle strong points. It lacks all Raju Hirani/VC effects.Yes, there are a few good comic scenes (the lecture is good but just drags and after a moment I was getting irritated by over-using of the words ""balatkar"" and ""stan"")And what should I talk about the screenplay, bakwas and weak, even most Imran Hasmi/Harman Baweja movies have good integrated script than this.Acting: Sharman Joshi is mentionable, Amir did overact, yes, I say it, just watch the scene when the dean drags him from his office to a classroom he acts like something funny is going on, scratches his head, a very loose body language and not at all matching to what a student might feel if he is dragged through corridor by the dean of a very renowned college of India. Amir just fails to portray a student.I can go on and on about its stupid loopholes, but lets stop here. Last but not the least, u have to bear some good but misplaced songs throughout the movie.Reading this far one can tell I hated this movie, then why u may watch it? 1>U will get some good laughs in a few good scenes 2>A good but repetitive theme 3>A feel good effect 4>Amir's only movie in this year (for Amir fans)"
A different Indian Movie but a little dragged on,7 January 2010,9.0,"I have a bunch of Indian and Pakistani friends and they were all going over the moon with this movie so I decided to watch it. There is one way to describe this movie and that is different.The story revolves around three engineering students who bond with each other. Rancho is a brilliant student who prefers to have fun and makes it his duty to help people in any way he can. Farhan is a student who loves photography and was forced to go to the top engineering school by his dad. Raju is a religious student from a poor family that tries to excel in the school. THroughout the movie, they have their little adventures and even a couple of surprises or two in the school they are studying in. While the movie is different from most Indian Movies, the movie is a little long and a little dragged on. While it is primarily a comedy movie and there are many jokes in the movie, most of them aren't that funny and there were some very babyish jokes (people pulling their pants down randomly and people talking to each other while on the toilets). Like most Hindi Movies, there were also some good songs, but one was a nonsensical song that sounded unusually similar to zipadee doo daa. Towards the end (last 45 minutes) the movie also became painfully predictable and did not match the explosive first hour that had me captivated. The message however was very well understood and very well put in the movie.Aamir Khan is an outstanding movie star and he shines in this movie and as I heard he also produced this movie, it greatly resembles his other movie, Taare Zameen Par, in which a kid that is dyslexic rises above the standard and traditional South Asian view that a child must learn a certain way. It parallels the moral of this story in which South Asian communities must broaden their views and be more flexible instead of forcing their children to becomes either doctors or engineers and to not put pressure on their children by asking high demands in education.Overall, its a movie to watch because of its message."
Another Munnabhai...Nothing great.,9 January 2010,2.0,No...Its not Sholay or Lagaan or even Hum Aapke Hain Kaun or Gadar. No I am not comparing with them. After noticing lots of popularity I was also pulled into the hype. But was disappointed to see another movie like Munnabhai. Same College and Principal and hospital etc. Not fresh story at all. Lots of old jokes. Some sequences are absurd. 3 idiots can take a old patient to Hospital but cannot take a pregnant woman and applies their engineering knowledge to deliver a baby. They can gather the whole college but not a single girl to deliver a baby. Like I said...its a good bollywood masala movie but nothing great. I don't know why some people are surprised about Aaamir's acting as a college boy. His face is still boyish and suits these kind of roles. May I ask in which film he looked like a Man? Arshad Warsi could have done better job in this movie. Now the good things. There were some good dialogues and good acting from Sharman Joshi(Raju) and Omi Vaidya(Ramalingam). This movie is Chatur Ramalingam's. The producers are clever to market the movie like Ghazni and make their money. After few days we audiences will look back and think how they made fool of us. This movie is worth watching only in DVDs.
"Now that, is a movie! Enjoyable. Fun. Unique. Brilliant. Emotional.",6 November 2014,2.0,"May I add to that, potentially life-changing!I would rate this movie somewhere between 9 and 10 , I wasn't sure which grade to give it, but 10 seems more appropriate.This movie actually , has many flaws. And I know I often watch a movie then rate it with a 5/10 , then rumble about it's flaws.. But, sometimes there is just something that you ""love"" and in it the flaws are minimized and overlooked. So it is with this movie for me. I love love love how inspiring it is. And how it can bring the emotions out of you. Make you connect and feel with the characters! This is simply amazing! Not many movies can do that. There are 2 or 3 scenes that I adore, and then there are others, flawed and all.. but still this movie is just special. A must watch. It starts a bit slow.. but you have to be patient. First half is good, second half is awesome! The cast in this movie is perfect! Amir, his friends, the teacher , the girl. Just perfect. And really the girl was an important role to cast and she is such a good choice! Looks wise at first you would think hmmm maybe not so much; but that girl has a spark that you will not find. I saw her in one other movie and so I knew what she could do, and surely as movie rolls along , she adds her sparkly personality and lifts the movie a notch higher. Aamir Khan has become my favorite Indian actor, and is perfect in this, and the professor is also such a good choice! Just wow! Why do I go on and on about the cast, because this cast made the movie what it is. It's not about how well you act, it's how well a role you are put into based on who you are. A super good movie! Different from Hollywood, very refreshing!Real rating: 9.35"
3 Idiots is one of the best!,30 January 2015,9.0,"Im not a Hindi movie fan, in fact, this is my first time to watch Hindi movie. But this film is totally blowing my mind! Great story, good script writing, best performance of Aamir and also others actors / actress too. 2 Thumbs up for 3 Idiots! Its not simply just a comedy, but with something to think about for our own, and also bring along with touching moment! The positive message from this film will definitely hit the viewers. It shows how most of people are react at this present moment. Like, do we really do what we love and love what we are doing? If there's a fear, do we really take the risk and overcome it? If there's an opportunity, do we see it and hesitate about it? Well, sometimes the results is not that important, the process is the most concern and 3 idiots really taught us we should appreciate the relationship with parents, friends, the one we love & care! The cinematography is good, the songs & music are nice too! Rajkumar Hirani is brilliant director and script writer! Salute. Rajkumar Hirani is brilliant director and script writer! Salute."
"Amazing, inspiring and enchanting - one of best movies I have seen",1 October 2012,9.0,"Talking about unexpected When you see the title of the movie and know that it was best grossing Bollywood film that went around the world as a hit all around – well, you expect something watered down, something for everyone. Maybe in some way it is for everyone, but by far this is not bad.The message is simple – follow your heart, follow your dream and All Izz Good (a little chant of main character – Rancho – used in stressful situations). In India engineering is a prestigious occupation where many Indian parents see as future for their sons. Story is set in Nr. 1 Imperial Engineering University where our 3 main characters – Farhan, Raju and Rancho - meet. Most students are there to blindly cram book, get best scores in exams, get good job and buy big houses and big cars. But Rancho is different – he loves engineering and does not like the school system, he tries to change it. Sounds familiar? Well it is. But this is story is special. It is about real friendship, real emotions and a person who is able to inspire people, shake their mechanical lives, and wake them up. (Oh, and it has Bollywood song-and-dance cuts too, a lot of fun). It is indeed very pleasant to watch.As usual I would like to ponder upon one of notions of the movie. We all in our lives are faced with important choices and struggle to answer dilemmas they give us. Who should we listen to when we choose most important things in our lives – the Tradition, our Parents and Grandparents, our God or Gods, our Friends, our Hearts or our Rational Mind? It is tough. Sometimes it seems to me it was easier in the times when you knew from childhood who you will be – a son of blacksmith will be a blacksmith, a son of tanner most probably will be a tanner (well, for girls even more easy – marriage – but that's another topic). In Hindu philosophy, in Bhagavad Gita, a similar question is discussed. A great hero Arjuna I faced with a dilemma – he has to fight the battle, as he is kshatriya, warrior cast, however in this case he would have to kill people he knows and loves. He consults his chariot driver - god Krishna. Krishna tries to persuade him to fulfill his duty, his dharma as kshatriya. It is better to be mediocre warrior if this is your dharma, than to be best cook in the world and go against it. A philosophy difficult to pursue in life, especially in modern world. I personally think that since industrial revolution and alienation of worker and his/her work (to borrow the term from Marx), there is no way to see the profession, a job in the same way as it used to be (like I mentioned – son of tanner is tanner, but it was not a ""job"" in nowadays meaning). Our jobs are almost a consumer choice, just usually more permanent one. You choose your career along with it comes the attached lifestyle (a doctors lifestyle is different from engineers, and it is not only about the money, it has much to do with the constructed image of the profession). So in ambiguity of modern world, what does constitute as dharma? Rancho says it is voice of your heart.The movie has a happy ending. And if it is not pretentious enough for some critics – well, eh I think some things need to have a happy ending.P.S. I wonder how many engineering students in India dropped out after seeing this movie"
"It talks about faulty education system, unnecessary study pressure, wrong high expectation of parents, increasing materialism and ignorance of human values THE FUNNY WAY",1 January 2010,9.0,"There are many people who find nothing useful in real working life which have been taught and studied with great pressure during their student life. There are many instances where students have taken last step as suicide when they can't handle the study pressure. There are people who have inner abilities and skill sets of some other field than the field in which they are currently working or say there are people who trying hard to establish themselves in the field according to their chosen career path but can not make the headway. Actually these kind of people might have realised that they have taken wrong path and that is because of parent's expectation, social status or may be because of peer pressure. There are people who are repenting after making career in the field in which they are not enjoying and have mindset that they would have been done better in some other field. There are parents with the mindset that some educational field are good and some are bad. This is may be because of status in the society, job market and money reward in the field. But by this way they are ignoring inner abilities of their child and take the part in spoiling their career. This is like curing the disease the wrong way by giving wrong drug. This way they are killing their real pleasure. There are girls and guys who repenting after getting married to a person who is so materialistic who running behind only money and has no value for human feelings. Finally this kind of marriage wont last longer and results in the divorce. The film is giving good message to all of above people with humour. Songs are also good and well placed in the movie.Over all it is another very good movie of Aamir khan."
More than just a movie!!!!,25 December 2009,9.0,"When I heard that Raju Hirani, Abhijat Joshi and Aamir khan were working on a project together, I expected something good. I was wrong, because 'good' is a gross understatement of a project as brilliant as '3 idiots'. Yes, I call it a project because surely it goes beyond the realms of just being a movie. I say so because this movie stirs a dormant chord in our hearts, a chord that was always there but never found voice at the right time. If in TZP Aamir Khan made you cry and understand, in 3 idiots he will make you laugh tears but make sure you get the point. I sincerely hope that this movie can bring about a social change that is urgently required in our country today. Yes, the story is loosely based on Chetan Bhagats novel but it's far from being a theatrical adaptation. It has a story which will keep you fairly intrigued, humor that you will love and a message that surely has a lot of depth. Three friends stuck in an engineering college where none of them like the way things are run. Only one of them, has the courage to take things into his own hands- that's your protagonist Aamir Khan. You'll like him from his first appearance on screen and end up loving him. In his 40's he looks supremely convincing as a cool dude in college with a kind heart. Throughout the journey,he manages to capture your hearts with a perfect combination of humor and heart. If in TZP we saw Aamir Khan the director, here we are privileged to see Aamir- the actor take centre stage. He is phenomenal in his role and leaves adjectives inadequate for his performance. Kareena, the daughter of the head of the college is his love interest. She does justice to her given screen space and surely gets a few hearts beating fast during ""Zoobi Doobi"". Moving on from the love angle to the larger picture. Contrary to what you have heard or might hear, this movie not only challenges the Indian Education System, it decisively rubbishes it on every front. More than that, it challenges us to question our way of learning, of questioning, of thinking. Here, Madhvan and Sharman Joshi deserve an ovation for being splendid throughout the film. The friendship you saw in Rang De Basanti among a larger group was easily matched if not bettered by Maddy, Sharman and Aamir. Boman Irani picks off from where he left in Munnabhai playing the comic bad guy of sorts to perfection. The direction is flawless in terms of plot, setting and casting as each character justifies his/her role to the hilt. Also credit to the director for a climax which is sure to catch you by surprise! If I was coerced to point out flaws in this movie, I would say that Aamir's fake name concept, continuity of the film(which is more than 10 yrs) was a shade unrealistic. Also, the music is good, but as I said earlier, good is an understatement for this film. The epicenter of this earthquake called 3idiots ( I call it earthquake because that's what it will causeat the box office!!) is ""Always do what you love!!"" All I can say is that the entire cast and crew of this project definitely love what they do because their work gives us ample proof. If you'v watched it, go watch it again, if u haven't then I don't know what you are waiting for!! Go watch it, enjoy it, feel it but most important understand it. My Rating:- 9/10"
All time favourite Movie Masterpiece,14 April 2021,9.0,"What a Movie .. belive me this is the best movie in the world. The content level 🔥 Acting Amir Khan each & every one & Driector Raju Kumar Hirani just salute to you.. Emotional, Heart' touching story."
Strangely enjoyable in it's own unique way,6 January 2021,9.0,"Bollywood movies are an odd bunch, with their camp, colourful and cheesy style. 3 Idiots is arguably one of the better ones, despite being far too long and ridiculously corny. Fun storyline, decent performances and dripping in vivid colour."
Rajkumar hirani is christopher nolan of india,30 July 2020,10.0,"Aamir khan mr perfectionist & rajkumar hirani is god of screenplay writing this movie is pure masterpiece what a charector writing what well made written comedy with emotions is directly touches the heart
This line is very imp
Success pe peeche mat bhago kabil bano success jhak marke peeche ayegi 🔥🔥"
Didn't like the name,14 May 2010,10.0,"I loved this movie, it was a very smart and enjoyable movie despite the length. I loved the characters specially Rancho, Pro Virus and Silencer. I am not a fan of music in movies but I loved the music in this movie. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the name: 3 idiots is not appropriate, it should have been ""Looking for Rancho"" or ""Al-its-wel"". Another thing was It doesn't explain much about why Rancho ran away from his friends and his love, it never explains why he couldn't express his love. You can sort of figure it out at the end of the movie, but is not that clear. Well despite all this it shows Hollywood that a movie can be funny and smart at the same time, and a college movie doesn't have to be about stupid humor, booze, bombshells and boobies."
Now it's clear why this have such popularity,27 November 2015,10.0,"I rarely watch this kind of movies. I mean ""real movie theater movies"". I usually watch low budget indie type mystery/scifi/horror movies, but this time I was looking some comedy to watch. And found this. And I'm very glad I did!Let's start with that fact this is comedy after all. It does this job very well. BUT, there is just A LOT more than that! This is clever, this is very, very emotional. Tears wasn't so far away to come for me. Really. I think I have never been so touched when watching a movie. And I'm not even very emotional person. (I think watching this alone with headphones contribute this fact.)Something also fascinates me about Indian culture also. I think the language is awesome! I have watched also the ""Slumdog Millionaire"" movie and must say that these are only two movies from India, which I have seen and jeez! Very good movies coming from Bollywood.All actor AMAZED me! Not to mention Aamir Khan definitely the most! What a talent. Of course, excellent directing was also very important! Such a clever screenplay. And I have also used to watch movies less than 2 hours but these three hours went in a flash when watching this.It's wonderful how this was actually comedy, but was also so instructive and emotional at same time. Loved it. Great work Aamir Khan and Rajkumar Hirani!"
Fun!,25 November 2012,10.0,"I love Chetan Bhagat's novels. I work with many engineers who immigrated to the US from India. Bhagat's novels (especially ""2 States"") help me appreciate the land they came from, that schooled them, and is still attached to their souls.Both ""Five Point Someone"" and ""3 Idiots"" tell about students suffering through college and the transformation to adulthood. Both stories are engaging, cleverly constructed and funny as hell, but they show different things, at a different pace. Novels show internal transformation, while movies show the transformation of relationships. Neither story is biographical. Neither story depicts ""reality"". Both stories work as fiction and frivolous entertainment. Both are respectful of their characters.If you want great art, read Tolstoy. To learn How Things Work, read Darwin. If you like the Marx Brothers, and you want to laugh your ass off, watch ""3 Idiots"". This is not a movie to make you think (Of COURSE universities in developing countries are lethally competitive) but to bombard you with the unexpected. Which for this westerner included the jarring Bollywood ""let's stop the plot and dance"", though in this case it is ""let's use dance to fire-hose a different set of sight gags at the viewers"". One part of your laughing brain can rest while another takes over. This movie will definitely engage all your humor muscles, including engineer and college nostalgia humor muscles if you have them. If you enjoy ""funny machines"", there are plenty of those, too.Some parts were beyond me - Silencer's idiosyncratic Hindi becomes mere word-substitution jokes in subtitle, and I'm left to imagine how his non-standard pronunciation and mannerisms are 2/3 of the humor Still, even Silencer and Virus were treated with respect - all the characters were victims of a situation created by colonialism, poverty, desperation, and ambition displacing love. You can cry or you can laugh - choose your movies accordingly. If you want to cry about abused students, watch ""Dark Matter"" (2007). If you don't like fart jokes, don't watch this movie, or read Benjamin Franklin, either.India turns out a lot of films. I'm sure all the elements of this movie are borrowed from others, and if you've watched a thousand movies you won't see much new stuff here. Good artists plagiarize, great artists steal, and these artists robbed the entire film vault. They pasted their swag together pretty well, and in some surprising (to me) ways.IMHO, a 170 minute movie is too long, which is why I give it a 9. But if they edited it down to 90 minutes, and kept all the best humor, I might have died laughing. It was never plodding, though it slowed from manic to almost sane in places.I'm buying 4 copies for Christmas presents - I have some godchildren that need their humor centers stretched. This ought to do it."
3 idiots,3 June 2014,9.0,"I can say this film the best movie. I love the film. There are comedy, drama, love everything in this film. The film is educative, tutorial, fluent and entertaining. While I was watching the film, I enjoyed. The is criticizing the education system of the India because the education system is teaching memorization and competition but Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad is finding wrong to the education system. Three friends are studying the best school of the India in ICE: Raju Rastogi, Farhan Qureshi and Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad. Raju wants business owner because for the maintain his home , buy his father's medications and her sister's marriage. Farhan is going to the best engineering school of the India in ICE because his father wants but Farhan loves photography and Farhan wants to be a photographer. Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad is very different character. There is a school manager . School manager is evil- minded, hard, snappish. There is a manager's daughter. Manager's daughter is beautiful, optimistic a girl. Ranco is giving direction to the lives of everyone. Follow strictly the film. The film is very beautiful."
"my take: at the least, you can't say you don't get a full-course meal of movies in one LARGE one",29 February 2016,9.0,"Unlike many who have commented here in the years since 3 Idiots was released in India and throughout the world, I am not well-versed with Bollywood movies - indeed, far as I can tell from his filmography, this may be my first Aamir Khan movie - so my take on this experience may be different from others. It's not even that I can't get into a cinematic whirlwind like this, as other filmmakers in other countries will (sometimes) go for BIG emotions and BIG turns like this one does (Love Exposure was something that came to mind during this, of all things). So if you read what I'm about to say and think I'm full of it or don't know what I'm talking about it, well, the latter may be about right, but I can still share my honest thoughts much as they are. And, as far as the most general impression, overall, this isn't too bad. Is it very good though, or as bad as certain IMDb message board posters might say since its ascension to the top 250 films of all time? In short, 3 Idiots is a full course meal of a movie, and it has so many types and moods of movie stuffed into one, like a Turducken or something: it's a broad college comedy, an Alvin and the Chipmunks farce (think about it, with Khan's Rancho as Alvin and the other two idiots variations of Simon and Theodore, sort of, plus the Chatur character as the 4th wheel), a soap opera about strict fathers and their children, a tragic tale about suicide meant to highlight a very real problem in Indian society, and of course for Bollywood a musical, not to mention a kind of moral story of what it means to be a teacher or a student and how to not be so uptight (another subtitle for this movie could be ""The System, They Just Don't Understand!"").It's even other things I'm sure, and the tones fluctuate and alter on a dime from one to the next. Case in point, there's a little more than mid-way through the film a very serious turn in the plot; nevermind how exactly it gets there, suffice it to say it's due to some late-night antics from Rancho with pals Raju and Farhan, with Raju most drunk the next morning in class and being forced to decide whether to be expelled or put it all on Rancho. Raju decides to jump out the window, though he doesn't die and he subsequently gets rushed to the hospital. Cue up the sad but (it can't be anything else) supremely heart-felt song that plays over as he is brought to stable condition. Then it becomes a rather crazy comedy of 'how do we wake up Raju' sequence as he is stuck in his, uh, comatose-sort of state and Rancho keeps saying wilder and wackier things to get Raju to wake up. And yet as broad as this is it's still serious... sort of.A lot of this happens throughout 3 Idiots; for a stretch of time the movie will take on something like a frat-house comedy (that's actually how the film seems like it will take shape early on, ""initiation"" sequence with butt-branding included!) but then it's (duh) also a romance with the headmaster/principal's daughter, Pia (Kapoor, pretty but also a very good actress) and Rancho since he not only is the cool/suave prankster but he also spots the phonies who try to have her hand as a significant other. But then it's also about Raju's sad (in black and white no less!) home life, and then it's also about how to function properly in an academic environment with Rancho sometimes like a, uh, RP McMurphy in Cuckoo's Nest turning the system upside down with the headmaster as the one-note headmaster. And then it gets into a musical number about things like ""All is Well"", which gets finished off by someone jumping off a ledge and to their death, which makes it uh... sad again, as it cuts to the pouring rain at a funeral.This may be de rigeur for those who are regulars for Bollywood cinema - for me, it was at times a startling experience, sometimes akin to getting whiplash on a roller-coaster. This is not to say it made the experience intolerable, however. It was surely made as a prestige/high-mainstream comedy/drama/musical-et-al, and it's the kind of movie that will have high-powered, super-slick musical set pieces (not quite as many as I expected, to be fair, and those that are here do stand out well and are the highlights of the movie aside from Khan's performance), and then for the regular musical score it will be some of the goofiest notes I've ever heard outside of a Disney channel show. And for as BIG as the actors go for this material - perhaps, you could argue, they don't have much of a choice - there are moments where there's something close to not subtlety but measured stuff; when Raju confronts his parents with what he actually wants to do with his life, it's a legitimately strong dramatic scene that pulls on the heartstrings just enough.In other words, it's probably not what will be the *best* Bollywood movie - some may put it high up there, and that's their prerogative - but if you are new to this style of movie-making (and I don't mean Slumdog Millionaire for the laymans that's basically Bollywood crossed with Danny Boyle), it's a good place to start. It's sometimes quite funny, and sometimes quite harrowing with its drama, and often it's much too much with the emotional manipulation (that delivery scene, my God). It is what it is."
"An average movie which still is better than most of the comedies which rolled out this year in Bollywood (Yes, that's the sorry state of Bollywood these days!).",1 January 2010,7.0,"Chetan Bhagat's novel on which it is loosely based, is not a literary masterpiece but it succeeds in selling what it promises. I think a more serious, drama with subtle humor approach should have been used to make a good movie out of that novel. What we have got in 3 Idiots is another addition to the streak of mindless comedies. One movie genre which has suffered the most in recent years is comedy and movies like 'Jane bhi do yaron' or even 'Andaz apna apna' or many of the Hrishikesh Mukherjee's movies are not made anymore. What we get these days is run of the mill gags with jokes copied from youtube (Search 'funny student at exam hall' if you want to see an example).Rajkumar Hirani has tried to emulate the success of Munnabhai films by using the same formula but has tried to pull one too many a stunt this time. Munnabhai movies were fresh, something new always works! Repeating same thing over and over is what killed 3 Idiots. Amir tries hard and gets away with it but definitely younger actors could have done a better justice. Madhavan as an actor and narrator fails big time in this movie. An actor like Sharman Joshi who has done quite decent job till now in comedies isn't given much meat in his role. In fact I would have loved to see him do the role of Rancho! Boman Irani's character is straight out of a cartoon book and its not funny at all. Surprisingly, Kareena Kapoor has done a very good job in the smaller than others role she got. It seems she succeeds in carrying this role forward from Jab We Met!Finally, I would say that this movie has soul, it has a message(in fact may be one too many ;) but it lacks execution. It fails to stick to this message with heart because of senseless and unbelievable comic scenes which are forcefully thrusted to get some quick laughs but ultimately prove to be roadblocks in the storyline. Many situations in the movie are so hard to believe that you can only gulp them down if the movie was a spoof which it is not. I have seen(and have been a part of) much crazier things when I was in engineering college but still what they show here is simply stupid.Watch this movie if you want to relax and watch some mindless comedy where you have to apply your brain... 6/10 for me."
Absolute rubbish.,27 December 2009,7.0,"Pardon my ignorance.When an actor of Aamir's calibre decides to act in a movie after a year from his previous release, and when you have a massive production house backing your movie with a director whose had two back to back hits, You tend to expect a lot from a movie.But instead what you get is 3 hours of absolute rubbish.The facts are simple. Add a Lil bit of humour to a pathetic story and publicise it well and let the cash registers ring, because its the year end and there a billion fans of Aamir, who have been waiting so impatiently for his next movie for over a year, so anything he signs is bound to be an instant hit. And that has been the case for most of his movies for the past decade. Even MANGAL PANDAY cashed in a lot in the first week. What mystifies me more is the way Aamir went about publicising this movie? I am still confused and a bit dazzled as to what was the link between the story of the movie and Aamir touring India as your everyday people.What mystifies me even more as to what made choose him this movie. There was nothing even close to what you would call challenging in this film, considering his previous performances.Lets start with his character Rancho, a college student . Lets be honest, he has played that in so many movies that he could now do that in his sleep. A free thinker who studies and preaches education by his own rules and practicality. Funny why does Patch Adams just keep springing to my mind. The only difference being Robin Williams and Rancho was that Robin was practising medicine in that movie and Rancho is practising engineering. There were many one-liners that i heard giggles in the theatre, but not many of them realise that they are so 2 thousand late.Like for instance the NASA pen scene or even the best gag of the film the Omi speech are lifted from either stand-ups or foreign movies.It was like watching a blend of Patch Adams, Rang De Basanti,Patch Adams, Munnabhai (the first one because that too was inspired by Patch Adams), Patch Adams & Taare Zameen Par together.And it was Shambolic mixture to be honest. Even the English song "" give me some sunshine"" is inspired by an old Hindi ghazal. And i am really annoyed that nobody else realised that. Probably because the language has changed. So i will have to spell it out to you, compare the lyrics of this song and a timeless classic by jagjit singh, ""Woh Kaagaz Ki Kashti"", and u will begin to realise, that every bit of this movie is either inspired or lifted from one or the other, in the same manner Ghajini was inspired from a certain Christopher Nolan film.Yes i did find something that i liked in the movie, and that is only one shot from the entire movie, although very predictable, but the scene in which joy is shown hanging to his ceiling fan was a brilliant piece of direction. Its the way that it was shot in that amazed me.With Lage raho , Hirani stamped his mark of brilliance in many ways. As a director, a story writer and a story teller. It was refreshing and unpredictable. Even the first of the Munnabhai series had plenty of laughs and frowns although that too was mostly an indianised version of Patch Adams. Mr, Hirani, move over the patch Adams hangover now. Its high time. I am sure you might find many other movies in Hollywood, that still haven't been indianised.And once again pardon my ignorance."
"""Chase Excellence, Success Will Follow""",7 March 2013,10.0,"An ordinary school story? Absolutely not. 3 Idiots ,in my opinion,the most exciting and different school-themed film of all-time.

Best Bollywood movie I've ever watched,4 September 2010,10.0,"One thing that comes to our mind when we say Bollywood is fancy stories with dream worlds. They are far for reality and almost nothing to take from it. But this movie stands still as a giant proving that Bollywood isn't all about synthetic dream worlds. This is a classic masterpiece with the combination of geniuses.Aamir khan my favorite actor in Bollywood shows here, he not just another actor but a man of wisdom. There are high class Bollywood celebrities, acting in very cheap movies even jeopardizing their well built reputation. One thing I notice on Aamir Khan is that he is not after each and every role only seek for the excellence. As he becomes successful with his career, he improves the way of thinking too. This maturity can be clearly visible in his productions too. (He could be the only Bollywood celebrity with a brain :)The plot of this movie is quite interesting and never get bored. Humor, Joy, Sorrow , feeling and everything is there. The specialty that tied my attention to this movie is the Dialogs. They are really a work of a genius. Rancho's dialogs as a college student perfectly call into our wisdom. They contains the thoughts of a philosopher. The message given by the movie is astonishing by the end. if it's summarized, ""Don't follow the success, only the excellence. Then success will follow you""This could be the movie that would change my life one day."
A Modern Day Classic!,30 April 2012,10.0,"First he taught us that laughter is the best medicine. With his second venture, he taught us the ways of piece and love through Ghandism. Now, with 3 Idiots, Rajkumar Hirani tells us to chase excellence and success will follow.I'm a viewer who believes the best way to send a message is through an entertaining way rather than a preachy way. A message through entertainment hits you harder than a boring and preachy one. Films, of course, are not meant to send messages, but it's always nice to see one that does. I honestly believe nobody can do it better than Raju Hirani - Currently the best director of Hindi Cinema.Like his previous attempts, Raju Hirani makes us laugh, cry and think all in one viewing. 3 Idiots not only introduces you to a new world, but also provides a fresh way of filmmaking and narration. Not to forget that it tackles an issue that not many have touched upon - The Education System.Years after graduating from college, Farhan and Raju receive a message from an old classmate, Chatur. Chatur claims that he has found their old buddy Rancho. Rancho, a free mind, an intelligent student, a good guy. Why is Rancho so important? What exactly did Rancho do? Why did he leave? Will Farhan and Raju find him? All that is depicted in the next nearly 3 hours of the movie.To start, 3 Idiots deals with a few things here and there. Whether it is the poor school system that discriminates and pressures you involving your grades. Whether it's you father forcing you to become an engineer and not allowing you to pursue your dreams. Or even a bright student who fears he may not be able to live up to the high expectations. Finally, 3 Ididots says one simple thing - Chase your dreams, demolish your fears and try your best - Success is a given.There are a number of significant moments I totally love in the movie. Aamir's introduction itself is a great start. I'll go on and say another lovely scene is when Farhan and Raju come last and find out where Rancho placed. Of Course, who can forget Chatur's hilarious ""Balatkaar speech"" Just Genius writing. There are more moments to cherish here. The whole climax is lovely. Mona Singh's baby delivery is gripping. Finally, Rancho's real identify being shown keeps you glued and enlightened all at once.My favorite part of the film is when Farhan and Raju decide their fates. Farhan confronting his father about his real dreams and Raju's interview - Just amazing moments.Flaws? I really don't see any. I do want to note that the film is almost 3 hours yet you do not feel like it has been that long.Rajkumar Hirani and his co writer really developed a nearly flawless script here. The lines are just amazing. They are fresh and also have that feel-goodness to them. The screenplay is excellent.The music of the movie grows on you. All Izz Well lifts your spirit. Give Me Some Sunshine is amazing. Behti Hawa is also an underrated song. Songs are pictured well.R. Madhavan gives his best performance in my opinion. His voice over is also a master stroke. He's got a strange innocence to him him this film. It works. Sharman Joshi is no less. He's just first rate. Especially in the scene when he goes to give his interview.Kareena Kapoor is actually acting well here. A great act. Boman Irani is first rate as always. He's just brilliant. His character is sort of similar to his earlier character in Raju Hirani's first film, Munnabhai MBBS. However, there's a huge distinction in Boman's act. Shows the man's versatility.Aamir Khan holds 3 Idiots together all through. I feel he should have gotten the best actor award that year instead of Amitabh Bachchan in Paa (That was a great act too) He looks the role, he's just perfect in every frame. You don't really expect anything less than that from Mr. Khan.All said and done, even Aamir would agree with me that the real hero of this film is Raj Kumar Hirani, the director. He's filled the movie with so many wonderful moments, extracted some memorable performances and has given one of the most entertaining films to Indian Cinema.What else can I say? Just a big thanks to director Raj Kumar Hirani, producer Vinod Chopra and actor Aamir Khan for giving us this modern day classic.In Munnabhi MBBS - It was a ""jadho ki jhappi"" In Lage Raho Munnabhai - It was ""Get well soon, mamu"" And now, it's - ALL IZZ WELL!"
What an amazing movie,16 July 2014,9.0,"This is the first movie that I want to watch AGAIN Bollywood is simply brilliant.10/10 for ""3 idiots"".Although this movie was old,but it still gold.I would like to watch this type of movie rather than watching some recently filmsFrom the actor,the story,effect and soundtrack,everything is almost perfect Furthermore,the movie inspire me to pursuit my favorite jobAnd I bet you will find the same thing after you watch ""3 idiots""""Pursue excellence, and success will follow, pants down."" Such a wonderful quote"
3 idiots,19 January 2022,9.0,"Oh, and I haven't watched Indian movies for a long time! The last movie I remember is the famous ""Zita and Gita"", which I watched with my parents as a child.Having accidentally watched the film ""Three Idiots"" by an Indian film company yesterday, I was surprised to find that the films have been updated since then.The film tells about three friends who study at the university and face boring idiots teachers, idiots students, idiots rich. The title of the film may mistakenly form an image of three vulgar morons in my head, as in the movie ""Dumb and Dumber"". In fact, the film is about three good, kind, intelligent and inquisitive guys who are not afraid to speak out against the system, are not afraid to say what they think. They are called idiots by primitive teachers and a boring director. I'm."
3 Idiots definitely tries to do things differently ... to certain extent successfully!,2 November 2011,10.0,"I generally avoid commercial Hindi films but I watched 3 Idiots because I was told that it does things differently. For the most part, I found that to be true.Story: While the theme of the story is quite valid it's hard not to notice that it was discussed by a very similar Hindi film starring Aarmir Khan recently (Taare Zameen Par). In both films Aarmir Khan plays a similar stand out role which create a continuous sense of déjà-vu. The main story line of 3 Idiots oscillates between being simple, heart-warming and humorous to outrageous and silly. This makes things pretty awkward. One moment you would be engrossed watching a story of two troubled students being helped by benignant idealist and the next moment the idealist starts acting like Jesus himself with infinite wisdom. The story never hits a good balance. Personally, wise cracking Aarmir Khan's character got under my nerves far too often.Acting: Acting for the most part was quite solid with the exception Kareena Kapoor. Either all Hindi film directors want her to act the same role in every film or she has been copy/pasted from another film. Most scenes involving her were predictable resulting all attempts at humor to fall flat. Direction/Editing etc: The film is pretty long which made me feel that editing was not great. There were a few scenes that were quite irrelevant and overdone. But 3 Idiots packed enough comedy and charming sketches to keep me interested until the end. The characters are skewed so much to black/white and right/wrong; the film gave me the sensation that the director wants me to enjoy the film in one particular way. There was very little to think about after watching. Visuals: Most of the scenery and visual elements used to drive the story along was quite good and well thought out.All in all, 3 Idiots is enjoyable and there are lot of things to like. It's still aimed at the core Hindi film fans but it's accessible enough for others too."
Bland and Boring......,2 January 2010,10.0,"It is only if I had not lost my movie sensibility, I would have been placed better. The best part about India is that everything has a following and Aamir Khan with his histrionics and verbal spats is in the midst of a great purple patch. Everything he is touching is turning into gold and it takes a modern day genius to do that. He is more like a good salesman then an actor. If you can sell the same college song after 21 years, you sure have to be awarded the best salesman in your industry. Well, the real disappointment is not Aamir, as he frequently makes bad movies...Fana and Ghajini to name just the latest 2 but he also carves out little gems like Taare Zameen Par every now and then. And the disappointment is also not from the fact that he is still playing the college Romeo. The disappointment is with Raj Kumar Hirani who in trying to accommodate Aamir's star power did what Shubhash Ghai did in Yaadein. The Box office verdict has been starkly different for both the movies because young India connects to the message of 3 idiots well. Critics with a few exceptions did not speak their mind because they knew that this movie was going to do colossal business. But the fact remains a fact....the ending was manufactured and seriously pretending. It was like that the script writer was superficially trying to make everybody smile while walking out. It is the first time Hirani has erred and hope that he does not slip again, as he has given 2 most memorable movies in recent memory. This does not even come close. The point of view was excellent, the treatment not."
One of the best movies of the decade. Don't be an Idiot and skip this movie!,24 December 2009,10.0,"Absolutely brilliant one. Decent humor, equally includes love and emotions. Very nice performances by Aamir Khan, R Madhavan, Sharman Joshi and Boman Irani. Kareena looks good but would get a 3 out of 5 for acting. The film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high- pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference. So, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non- conformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.This would easily get a 9.5 out of 10. Don't be an idiot and skip this movie!"
Wonderfully Entertainment,2 July 2014,10.0,"It's hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.Like so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since ""3 Idiots"" is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films."
Motivational movie,9 December 2013,7.0,"I really loved this movie. When you don't understand the logic why people around you stress the importance of studies, then probably the best motivational movie around to watch is '3 idiots'. Aamir (Rancho) showed how dedication and hard work in studies can take you to the heights of success. The movie proved yet again that Aamir is one of the best and creative minds in bollywood. One of the rare movies that keep your guessing and maintains the suspense right through the end.The movie is a whole package, its about true friendship and love. A must watch movie. Totally worth watching movie, you wont regret watching it even if you will have to watch it with subtitles."
A must watch,18 June 2015,7.0,"I had to write a review because of how amazed I was by this incredible movie,I was also surprised that their is only one review.This movie will not only deliver a message but will also be very entertaining delivering the message.I was not bored at all nothing was wrong,my unprofessional opinion is that this movie has no flaws.The message is very clear in this movie (chase excellence success will follow)The acting was really stunning, Aamir Khan was great ,Madhavan and Sharman Joshi were as great and of-course Boman Irani(college directer) we can't ask for a better performance.I also have to say Rajkumar Hirani (the real director) did a great job.I seriously think if this movie is in America it would win an Oscar in Best Picture,Best Directing,Best Actor in a Leading Role,Best Actor in a Supporting Role,Best Music."
Good. But misses the Bullseye !!!,28 December 2009,7.0,"It certainly is all over town. Aamir's next has been hyped immensely and it's not surprising if you are not able to find a movie ticket this weekend. But at the end it all boils down to the question - is the movie worth all the hype ?? After watching it, I can say that the answer (quite disappointingly) is no.Two college friends - Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) embark on a journey to find the third friend / Idiot Rancho (Aamir Khan) who mysteriously disappeared after college five years ago. The film's story is told through flashbacks as the characters journey to Shimla in search of Rancho - the person who managed to change their outlook towards life.The problem with 3 Idiots according to me is that although it tackles a very complex issue, it chooses to do so in a light-hearted way which essentially converts this movie into a comedy (something present in abundance in B-Town). No doubt the humor is top-notch and keeps you rolling in laughter but the movie simple fails to connect you emotionally with the characters as opposed to, for example, Taare Zameen Par (2007) which I feel, after watching this, is far more superior in terms of characterization and emotional depth. By the time it reaches the climax, you can well anticipate almost everything that would happen.As for the performances, they are top-notch. Undeniably, Aamir is one of the finest and this movie reaffirms this. However, what most people seem to be forgetting is that there are two more actors in this movie who, given the opportunity, are as capable as Aamir themselves. First R. Madhavan as Farhan Qureshi is simply brilliant. Watch the scene wherein he tries to explain his point of view to his parents. Next, Sharman Joshi as Raju Rastogi really shines not just in the comic sequences but in the more serious ones (which the movie has very few). Revealing the sequence in which he shines may act as a potential spoiler but watch out for a scene in the principal's office in which the principal asks him to type a rustication letter. Kareena Kapoor is really a thorn in this movie and her romance with Aamir is something that should have been either toned down or chopped off. Omi as the ideal geek is impressive (more so than Kareena).The cinematography is good and breathtaking in the opening song where the lush greenery of Shimla is captured with such finesse that it induces a sense of wonder. The music is good but the songs have not been used that effectively. For instance, ""Give Me Some Sunshine"" not only has weak choreography, but it comes at a moment which severely reduces its impact. The promo featuring that song was far superior (in fact that was what fooled me into believing that this movie could end up as a masterful lesson in life). Some of the sequences could have been trimmed down.On the whole, although 3 Idiots is a good movie, it is hard to understand people calling a masterpiece or a breakthrough in cinema. Movies like Taare Zameen Par (2007) or even Hirani's own Lage Raho Munnabhai (2006) are better movies as compared to this. Nevertheless, the movie does provide some really good entertainment so if you're looking forward to just relax and chill out, go for this. For those however seeking some serious depth and a perspective in the life of an engineer, I'd say the movie tries and succeeds in parts but an engineer's life and the pressures s/he faces are a different game altogether. Although the movie it enjoyable, it is far from authentic. And this comes from an Engineer (although an Idiotic one). Now I may get a lot of sore thumbs down on this one but this in my opinion on this movie written in all earnestness. Don't enter this movie with high expectations and you may perhaps find that All Izz (Indeed) Well !!!Score: 7.0/10.0 !!"

"Fairly idiotic, but it's not that bad",1 October 2011,1.0,"Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots is generally a rather entertaining comedy, but as a film it is only partially successful. Though it does have its moments, it never really manages to completely deliver and lacks the power to enthrall. It mostly works as a senseless comic ride and only occasionally does it convince when it tries to convey a message. The film is quite messy in presentation, and it is a tiresome task to follow the proceedings as every now and then the story moves confusingly between past flashbacks and present developments. The movie is good in many ways, and at times it's very funny, but it is the overall product which is faulty. The dialogue is for the most part excellent, so is the visual style, but then, the script lacks focus. While Hirani's direction is quite smart and creative at times, he often tries to include too many elements, and, as a result, the movie often seems to go nowhere. The humour wavers between witty moments of hilarity and cheap, unoriginal gags. And then we also have poor sequences of overdone melodrama and manipulative sentimentality, which are incorporated rather forcibly into the movie and they really fall flat. The entire birth sequence, for one, is one hell of a cliché. So is the ending, which is sugarcoated to the max. Where acting goes, the one who does the best--and probably the only great--job is definitely Boman Irani, who is simply hilarious as the lisping, authoritarian college professor. Aamir Khan looks younger than his actual age but is still too old for his role. Acting-wise, he's just ordinary and offers nothing particularly impressive. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi are given little scope and only few short episodes here and there for themselves so that they don't end up unsatisfied from taking part in this film. They do reasonably well, but Joshi is made to cry far too much, and it really gets on one's nerves. Now who's left? Oh, Kareena Kapoor! Well, she is pretty but she is given a thankless blink-and-miss part which is neither significant nor demanding. That said, though she is hardly there, she does well when she is and her presence is pleasant. The songs are quite catchy and fun, but none of them is particularly memorable. ""Zuby Duby"", however, is superbly visualised and is enjoyable enough. Overall then, 3 idiots is an okay film at best which is flawed and terribly overrated, but in all fairness, it is reasonably enjoyable and may provide decent Hindi entertainment for the entire family. According to me, it is worth nothing more than a one-time watch."
For smiting those who are lame enough to give this movie a one or a two star rating,12 July 2013,1.0,"An experience to behold. This movie evoked the extremities of my emotions. Most here on IMDb have appropriately lauded this flick, so any more appreciation on my part will simply turn out to be quite monotonous. I have penned this review to ponder aloud on the narrow lives of those who hated this flick enough to give it a one star rating.Frankly, I did not find more than one or two of the one-star reviews genuine. There is this one guy that compares this movie to the other top 250 movies on IMDb. How lame is that! I mean I have known only professional critics juxtapose movies just so that they could rank them; they are simply forced to compare movies. And judging by that particular person's command over the language and his lack of technical knowledge, he was not even remotely associated with any major critic; why then that absurd comparison? This same guy also cited something about the movie liked by 'mainstream dumb folk'. This comment in itself is dumb. Did he know that Shawshank Redemption was a mainstream flick, and that it was rated highly by the same 'mainstream dumb folks'? You are on IMDb for Satan's sake; this is the place where people other than professional critics rate movies. If I was forced to think like critics, I would say that there are more than a couple of movies better than 'Shawshank..'; Pulp Fiction, The Dark Knight, City of God, The Godfather, to name a few. Hope you get the point.There were a couple of other guys who actually slammed the acting. I wonder, do they even know anything about acting? Being an actor of a small repute myself, I would have no qualms against the acting prowess of the performers, apart from a negligible few areas that needed improvement. And from a consumer's eyes, they made me believe, and there is no higher praise than that.Well, if they are hard-to-please enough to rate the movie a one, why didn't any of them comment on the direction? That is because either there were hardly any points in regards with direction that they could criticize, or they are not literate enough to even know anything about direction.There was this other guy that liked 'Five Point Someone' more. He felt that the movie didn't do justice to the novella. I can only say that the person's list of favorite books would most certainly not be to my taste. I obviously won't say this unless I had read the book, and I wonder how it was successful commercially. The movie is way better than the book. Hell, I shouldn't even be comparing the two.Some other guys claimed that the movie wasn't realistic. Now, since when has the Dark Knight, The Lord of the Rings, The Godfather, Shawshank, Psycho, or Casablanca - I could go on and on - been realistic. Some of them may have been based on a real phenomenon, but they certainly were not out-and-out realistic. We watch and appreciate these movies just for the cinematic experience they offer. So don't give that realism crap. Movies are meant to be a figment of someone's imagination depicted artistically.Some even quoted the movie's similarity to Munnabhai MBBS. Wow, I don't see where that has come from. It's like 'Django Unchained' is 'Reservoir Dogs' all over again. Wake up call! They are two entirely different movies.Don't even get me started on other haphazard criticisms. There were only 2 or 3 people in the one-two star club that convinced me in regards to their rating. Others seemed more like wannabes or trolls, or simply sad souls. I gave this film 8 stars, and dropped 2 stars primarily because of the songs, and its unnecessary larger-than-life portrayal. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie."
One of the best Indian movies I have seen...,27 December 2009,8.0,"Superbly made movie. All actors have done a splendid job but as always Aamir has acted his heart out. His performance stands out...one of his top 3 performances I would say...What makes this movie special is the way facts (positive as well as negative) about our education system have been put forth. Serious issues like students committing suicide under the pressure of performing well in the academics make you sad, concerned and angry at the same time. Another point to be noted is, Rajkumar Hirani has done an exceptional job in getting a college student out of all 3 actors (Aamir, Madhavan and Sharman)I strongly recommend watching this movie. Don't miss it."
A landmark entertainer in Indian Cinema!,27 December 2009,8.0,"""Chase excellence and success will follow"". This is what Rancho (Aamir Khan) preaches in 3 Idiots and Rajkumar Hirani delineates the ideology with such adroitness in every aspect that it marks a monumental event for Indian cinema. In terms of the sheer inspiration that it instigates, this film resembles the greats of 'Rang De Basanti', 'Taare Zameen Par' and the 'MunnaBhai' series while being the most entertaining film after 'Andaz Apna Apna'. After introducing simple but relevant concepts like 'jaadu Ki jhappi' and Gandhigiri to the population at large, Hirani now teaches us 2 more concepts:Consoling the heart by saying 'all is well' may not solve your problems but it will give you the courage to face them. Being an 'idiot' in an institution that chases grades and success is absolutely fine if you are in the pursuit of gaining knowledge and exploring your own talent to its potential. Our system needs to evolve in order to encourage us to pursue what we really want to do with our lives. As Rancho rightly criticizes the Director of the ICE about the college having produced numerous rankers but not a single student who has been creative enough to invent anything with what he has learned. 2 of the idiots, Farhan (R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) leave everything they're up to and along with their dorky college buddy Chatur (Omi Vaidya) begin a journey in search of their long lost friend Rancho, who left them abruptly several years ago. This beautiful journey through Shimla, Manali and Ladakh sends Farhan down memory lane to reminisce the manner in which a free spirited 'Rancho' entered their lives and changed them forever. The non-conformist Rancho rightly questions authority that suppresses free thinking. Every class that he attends is a revelation of sorts for the professor and the students alike. Through outrageously funny incidents and scenes, Rancho gradually changes the way his friends run the relentless race. His influence even spreads to the director's daughter Pia (Kareena Kapoor), leading to even more outrage for the Virus. Through all the hilarious series of events, Hirani also voices his ideologies in some deeply moving scenes to give us an insight into the flaws of the educational system. Its demands are severe on students who are forced by parents who dream for them on their behalf and families that live in sheer misery hoping for the son to become a money-making engine. The latter is humorously depicted as a typical 1950s family in black and white melodrama that makes you sympathize and laugh at the same time. Touch of genius there...Even after a shocking twist at the end of first half, the film continues its pace while never losing the steam of entertainment. The film's climax is shot in the spectacular landscapes of Ladakh. Speaking of which, the cinematography CK Muraleedharan is outstanding! After painstaking attempts to shoot at the heavenly location, he did manage to catch it in all its majestic splendor. His work overall gives a real, enriching look to the film. Shantanu Moitra's music WILL not sound like the most appealing when listened to prior to watching the film. It is the manner in which the songs are timed in the storyline and the relevance of the lyrics with the characters that enables the music to grow on you. Give me some sunshine and Behti hawa are the examples of this. All is well was a super-hit from the on-set itself with its catchy theme. As the usual case is with Hirani's films, the performances are impeccable. Boman Irani as the oppressive director must feel at home with his role as a dean but he still has the ability to impress us with his remarkable portrayal of Virus. Kareena Kapoor has proved her talent in a role that did not require her Kambaqt Ishq attire but rather her true self as a good actress who, when given the right role to work with can prove to be worthy. Omi Vaidya is a discovery here. His speech on stage is one of the most hilarious moments in movies and his inept Hindi and dorky behavior are aspects of his brilliant performance. R. Madhavan shows finesse and a lot of confidence in playing his character. His scene with his father, Parikshit Sahni is the epitome of his performance. Sharman Joshi has displayed his comfort with comedy before and it is a delight to watch him repeat his act from Rang De Basanti rather than that of his other films. Aamir Khan once again, shines light on a rich, well scripted character. His brilliance levels with his commitment as an actor. He proves yet again that true performances only come with understanding and studying the character that one has to portray. He frankly has too many noteworthy scenes but he is at his best while confronting the impregnable Virus. He is the voice of Hirani's ideas and creativity and an astounding personification of a character only he could've played with such virtuosity.But 3 Idiots is not all about how great Aamir was. This film is extraordinary because it gets the most rudimentary part of film making right - the screenplay and script. With the combined talents of Abhijat Joshi and himself (story, screenplay, dialogs), Hirani's basics in film making achieve overall perfection. There is something unique and entertaining happening in every scene and you would kick yourself if you take a restroom break.It would suffice to say that 3 Idiots is a landmark film and is set to become one of the biggest blockbusters by the virtues of Rajkumar Hirani and that of his immensely talented team including some of the finest actors. This film deserves multiple viewing and you know what?.... You'd still want to watch it again.9.505 on a scale of 1-10."
Best Movie,29 December 2009,10.0,"I saw this movie on Thursday on its first show this is one of superb movie made in this decade in Indian Cenema Plot is superb, Acting is superb, Songs are superb..The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervalsThe movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Omi Vaidya (Silencer) were superb in their roles.. Aamir did a great Job, this is One of his Best movie.....Other Actors like Mahadevan and Sharman Joshi are also Superb. Karina Looks fine in small role given to her so i rate 10 out of 10 to this one"
"Superb movie, a must watch",25 December 2009,7.0,"Amir and Bomman Irani rocks!!! Amir has done it again! A must watch at least once!!! Karina looks gorgeous. Madhavan and Sharman also look impressive. Fantastic comedy. Shooting in Ladhak is very beautiful. Movie is superb depicting Indian education system's drawback. Amongst the performances, Aamir Khan is stupendous as the system-breaker Rancho. A special mention for Boman Irani who is principal as 'Virus'.Music score, which may have sounded okay sort in the audio version, comes alive on screen with pakka lyrics. Finally one come out of theater humming ""Aal Izz Well"" tune. Hence guys go and watch at least one"
A hilarious and very much Bollywood conceptualization of 2 stories,28 February 2014,7.0,"Its definitely a fun movie, without doubt. Copied ideas? Yes! Melded a whole lot of stories that the Indian audience don't know? Yes! Made it purely entertaining and relate-able to the Indian mass? Yes!!What's wrong then? Should have given credit to the stuff they were 'inspired' from... so that we could check out those classics too afterwards and appreciate the original work too.You should definitely see 3 Idiots, before seeing the 'inspirations' to totally appreciate the work. And after watching the movie... give a couple of weeks (if u liked it) and then watch 'The Paper Chase' (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070509/) and read the book 'Five Point Someone' (by Chetan Bhagat). Both the old school movie and the book are definitely worth reading and makes you appreciate the movie that bring all these together. *spoiler* There was a hilarious scene which I later found out was from a NZ commercial. Watch this only after watching and appreciating the movie :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXRZcJI9yx8*spoiler end*Watch 3 Idiots if you have not read Chethan Bhagath prior to it. Read the book after if you haven't already...because that was 1 of his books worth appreciating. Watch 'The Paper Chase' also afterwards. You can even just listen through parts of it instead of actually watching...rather than listening to the menagerie of songs that gets you off track in 3 idiots at times."
Great entertainment...,24 January 2014,8.0,"""3 Idiots"" is a comedy movie and it will entertain you very much and I am sure that you will like it. When I heard the title of this movie I thought that this movie it will not be nice but after I saw the trailer of it I reconsider my opinion and I saw it.I want to tell you that ""3 Idiots"" is a great movie and I like it, don't judge a movie by its title. I also liked the interpretation of Aamir Khan who was really great such as Madhavan was.Finally I have to tell you that the songs of this movie are really nice and I liked them. Rajkumar Hirani did great job in the direction of this movie and this is obvious throughout the entire film."
1 Idiot,20 October 2015,8.0,"I feel like a fool wasting three hours on what practically is the Indian equivalent of the Three Stooges. With some context, this was the first Bollywood film I had seen, and it doesn't make me want to rush back and view more. The jokes are pretty unfunny, almost inline with unintelligent slapstick comedy and weird foreign comedy. Nothing in this film made me want to continue viewing; poor acting, a poor script and horrible cinematography are among the worst I've ever seen.3 Idiots may be a favorite in it's homeland, but as a foreign viewer to India, I had a huge problem with viewing it. The jokes fall flat, very flat and the story feels juvenile and childish. 3 Idiots is among the worst in IMDb's top 250 and I discourage viewing at all costs."
Bollywood comedy blockbuster: pee jokes and wholesome life values,30 January 2010,7.0,"Released around Christmas 2009 in over half a dozen countries '3 Idiots' , reportedly the highest grossing Bollywood movie of all time, earned $70 million worldwide within 18 days of entering theaters. It was also officially released early to YouTube, another first. In the US, where it's being being shown at AMC/Regal theaters, it made $5.5 million in its first 17 days, the highest US take for a Bollywood import.So what is this paragon? No 'Slumdog,' it's much more a standard commercial Indian film product. That means it's long, it's got tears, laughter, excitement, music and dance, and homilies about work and family. It's got romance, a beautiful girl who finds the hero in the end, and it's got running pee and fart and bum jokes. The screenplay of '3 Idiots' is drawn from Chetan Bhagat's 2004 bestseller Five Point Someone, a novel initially published in English and later reissued in Hindi. Bhagat's novel deals with the college exam angst and romance issues of three student buddies. But the film goes further afield, including childbirth during a blackout due to a monsoon flood, travels through gorgeous mountain landscapes of Ladakh seen from the air, trips back and forth over the period of a decade, one marvelous scene when a professor's mass of equations and symbols float off the blackboard up into the lecture hall, caressing the students. There are several full-dress Bollywood song-and-dance numbers, one in a hospital. The bright-colored cinematography is pleasant to look at. '3 Idiots' is virtually an epic of shared coming-of-age experiences with wholesome messages. These are: be true to yourself, live your dream. Be positive: the hero's mantra is ""Aal izz well."" Don't cheat -- unless you have to in a good cause. Don't rely on memorizing stuff; think for yourself. Avoid obsessing about the price and value of things. Remember where you came from. Remember your friends. The pressures of school in India where it may be the only way out of poverty are made clear, including the high incidence of suicide among students.And learn Hindi. There's a sequence when a nerdy materialist who lived abroad and didn't study it much is chosen to give a public address in a high-falutin literary form of the language, ending up with some lines in Sanscrit, which he's even more ignorant of. The buddies inject naughty substitute homonyms like the equivalent of ""screw"" for ""serve"" and he becomes a laughing stock.It's this materialistic memorizer bloke, Chatur Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya), who starts off the pre-title sequence by calling Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) to say he's located their engineering school pal ""Rancho"" (Aamir Khan) who disappeared after graduation. Farhan has to take the annoying and materialistic Chatur along as he rounds up best buddy Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) to drive from New Delhi up to the mountain town of Shimla to find Rahcho, the pal who influenced and inspired them so much. Much of the film consists of flashbacks along the trip of all the many incidents that happened in engineering school, many involving the annoying and sadistic school principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), AKA ""Virus,"" who has a beautiful daughter, Pia (Kareena Kapoor).The mercurial and diminutive Khan is so talented he gets away with playing Rancho as a student even though he's forty-something. Rancho is a compelling character: he's the inspiration, the catalyst a young person needs to move beyond his origins and live his dreams. Farhan is from a middle class family and has a huge talent for nature photography; his dad has pushed him toward engineering but he hates it. Raju comes from a dirt poor family -- images of his sick father, unmarried sister, and failing mom are in old-movie black and white -- and the way the family's future is resting on his engineering degree so terrifies him that he continually panics and fails the school tests. But he's a tremendously decent, soulful fellow whose rigorous honesty ultimately wins over potential employers. Rancho, whose origins are as obscure as his brilliance is evident, bows to no one and gets away with all kinds of infringements of the rules because or his inventive mind and fundamental decency.This summary barely scratches the surface. '3 Idiots' moves with precipitous speed through a dizzying array of incidents. A puzzling surprise comes just before the mid-way ""Interval."" And I said it was long. With that ""Interval,"" the movie keeps you in the theater for three full hours. That's a lot of Hindi, and only a little English. But this feels like a cleansing, warm bath after Judd Apatow and Eddie Murphy. This is good entertainment, and it's neither mindless nor nasty. But is it art? Is it groundbreaking? No, one couldn't say that. It's just a breath of good humor and good sense from a more innocent place."
Over-hyped Movie. Good fun for half the way,29 December 2009,7.0,"I watched this movie yesterday with my family. To begin with, I quite liked the concept about engineering college and the pressures. There were a lot of funny scenes which had the audience in splits. The comic timing of all the actors Amir, Sharman Madhavan and Boman Irani was really good. Chatur is just remarkable, what a launch for him. And when I came out at the interval i was pretty happy. I thought the film would continue in the same way in the second half.But the second half was too filmy. I mean what was Javed Jaffry s character doing in the film? His character was most confusing and unbelievable. I felt that the romantic angle was totally unnecessary and a bit forced as if just introduced to put some masala in the flick. Had the writers stuck to the basic plot about fun in college and avoided romantic side-angles, it would have been more crisp and slick.I thought the film would focus also on all the fun in other years, college fests labs etc. But they missed out on all that. And, the pregnancy scene could have been avoided. That was too ""filmy"". But otherwise, good story with a nice social message about the lopsided educational system in India. Hope some teachers and people involved in the education industry watch this movie and try to do something to correct our outdated, one-sided education system.There is another thing that stands out in this movie- the cinematography. whether its the college ambiance at IIM Bangalore or Shimla or Ladakh etc. has been nicely captured. Music is also good and keeps you entertained.That said and done, this movie is just an entertainer.Just leave your brains at home while watching this, especially the in the second half."
Amazing & Inspiring! One of the Best!,1 October 2014,1.0,"In my opinion, ""3 Idiots"" is one of the best films that I have ever watched. The directing was unique. The acting was outstanding and very natural. The cinematography was very clean and smooth. The story was amazing and inspiring. The musical parts are fantastic. For me, it is a perfect film. I liked every thing about it. The TRT was approximately 3 hours, yet every seconds and minutes of it was perfection. At first I thought it was just like the same ""common"" type of comedy film. But I was wrong, it was different. It was unique in many ways. The mixture, chemistry and transitions of comedy and drama of this film was done perfectly. This is the kind of film that all people should watch. This is the kind of film that will teach you a lot of moral lessons in life. This film will help enlighten people and I promise to all that this film will change your life."
ALL TIME FAVE COMEDY DRAMA MOVIE.,31 March 2019,1.0,"A heartfelt movie that gives many social lessons. Watching this movie from start to finish feels like experiencing an entire journey along with these characters all the way. It makes u have a good and fun time as well making u think. I watched it 100 times already and u will still like it. Funny, inspiring, emotional, teaches many lessons, tells how to live!!! BRAVO!! 🏅"
Very joyful movie !,4 December 2012,10.0,"I watched it finally on DVD.The film is very good in every sense It's players , dances , winding key was too perfect You can laugh and cry in this film the film is entertaining ,feeling and meaningful There is perfect an Indian dance such as in every Indian film.Story Two friends Raju Rastogi(Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi(R.Madhavan) embark on a quest for a lost buddy Rancho(Aamir Khan). On this journey, they encounter a long forgotten bet, a wedding they must crash, and a funeral that goes impossibly out of control.I loved every moment of this movie. and I hope to watch a lot of future Indian movies like this.The movie is highly recommended to 'students' specifically."
Beautiful,7 September 2015,10.0,"I usually don't like movies from India. Specially because of cultural differences between west and east. However, this movie was different. The first half of movie had, indeed, a lot of Indian movie characteristics that made me feel the difference between hollywoodian movies and the bollywoodian - I suppose there is where this movie came from - ones. Besides the funny parts - expected from a self described comedian movie - the movie was disappointing me... until it started the second part. This final part added the drama needed for a perfect movie: it showed us real human problems. Even more: it showed how to solve it. All in a funny way. The main problem of the movie was: should we follow our heart to do what we like in our professional choice or just do what our parents ""suggests""? Other secundary problems - but not less important - were showed as well and all the adventure to solve it made the movie simply beautiful. Highly recommended."
Old wine in a new bottle kinda movie..disappointing and below average.,17 January 2010,8.0,"I just managed to catch this movie on TV today and I must say that I have never seen a more disappointing and old wine in a new bottle kinda movie. Lets face it, its a complete blend of Dil Chahta Hai, Rang De Basanti, Munnabhai MBBS..and other lesser known college dramas. The message is way too out-and-out..it could've been subtle, lined with situations carefully and intelligently weaved into the plot. 40 plus actors playing college kids is blasphemous! Stereotypical character development, average acting, old timer jokes..it just doesn't fit. The movie couldn't raise my interest even a bit. And I'd make a special mention of the wedding scene, reminded me of Aamir's Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahi. Its just one of those typical Bollywood mix 'n' match flicks with absolutely no soul. I really don't understand the hype and hoopla about it. Below average."
My favorite movie of all time,20 September 2015,8.0,"This is the kind of movie that you can watch over and over again, yet feel like you've never watched it before. The use of comedic flavor and serious drama complement each other perfectly to develop the central theme of the movie (which applies to a lot of people studying in countries where rote memorization is the primary approach used to study). Omi Vaidya is the actor that I felt really stood out in this movie. Aamir Khan and the rest of the core actors did a wonderful job in their roles, but Vaidya presented the perfect impressions of someone who has been corrupted by the flawed educational systems of these Asian countries.As for the rest of the components, they were absolutely outstanding. Hats off to Hirani and Chopra for meticulously developing a very realistic script and conveying a strong, profound message at the end. I felt that the inclusion of some of the songs was unnecessary, but that's just my opinion. This movie does span almost 3 hours, but the 3 hours will pass by like water roaring down from a waterfall.Whenever you get a chance, watch this movie. Not only will you laugh and cry, but you will also be able to take back a very valuable life lesson.10+/10"
"Great Movie, 3 Hours Full of Emotions, Crying and Laughing",30 November 2013,8.0,"I have seen this movie last year. I had seen ""Like Stars on Earth"" before and I loved it too. As I know this one was similar, and as I really like Amir Khan's movies I decided to watch. I liked this one more than ""Like Stars on Earth"" I am a teacher and in this movie there are great messages for all teachers and especially for parents. Education is the most important thing to have a bright future. Not only for people, also for countries. ""3 Idiots"" show the importance of correct educational choices and how teachers and parents play a very important role. The movie gives that message in an entertaining way but also touch people's heart. Although the movie is about India and Indian educational system, so similar problems happen every corner of the world. After I watched this movie, I knew I would watch it again. I recommended this to my students and my friends. I was not able to watch this movie with my students but I watched it with some of my friends and whoever I watched with or I recommended, loved it."
Best 3 hours in many many years,25 August 2014,8.0,"Many movies I watch, I try to think of the positive in them so I can give a fair score. This movie, I feel happy scoring it a 10, because it is simply marvelous. I did not have to think of the good things in it, it is just Good.I recommend watching it non stop if you can allocate the three hours. Careful who you watch it with, you will cry many many times.I won't describe the movie for you, it touches on human character. You will love it no matter what.For the comedy part of it, you will simply laugh from happiness. How much better is that than laughing at artificially constructed jokes? Thank yous dearly whoever did this movie."
Must watch!,27 December 2009,8.0,"Just came home after watching 3 Idiots and I can't wait to go back to see the movie again. Absolutely fantastic movie which I believe is going to be one of the classics like Andaz Apna Apna was - an all time favorite movie you could watch any time and any number of times.Raju Hirani comes back with a masterpiece and it has perfection written all over it. Nice story, nice narration, superb acting and great direction. I was hoping the movie wasn't a remake of the book and was glad to see that the basic characters and storyline were picked up and everything else was original. The actors were very believable in their roles - not for once did they look any older than students barely out of their teens and blended really well into their characters. The movie keeps you so into itself and had so much to offer that when interval came, I started wondering what could they come up with for the second half but they came back with something even better!The story is of 3 guys - Aamir Khan as Rancho, Sherman Joshi as Raju and R. Madhavan as Farhan going through their 4 years in an engineering college and beyond. All throughout the movie they were their characters and not actors. The movies is beautifully presented and is a laugh riot and has some very emotional moments. It all fits together and you can totally relate to the characters whether or not you went through those 4 years of engineering college like I did. The storytelling is brilliant and it doesn't have second which I found boring or felt like forwarding.Music is nice - not great but it fits with the movie. The movie also has a message about the education system in India and is very true.10/10 :)"
"Excellent, deserves 9/10 for a Bollywood movie",24 December 2009,8.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed the movie, the college humor, the extremely well done dialogs, picturesque cinematography, nice and fluid flow storyline - in fact most of the movie.Only turnoffs were the over-Bollywoodisation out of the realm of the believable, overdoing gross scenes like repeated showing of male rumps/undies. Some director just don't know where to draw the line. Maybe a Farhan Akhtar was needed for a final editing touch :-)But the movie overall manages to fully entertain and keep you in splits or at times tears during the entire time. Would be a 9.999/10 without the turnoffs - exactly where it falls half a point below ""Dil Chahta Hain"", though personally it is funnier!Extremely well cast. Aamir manages to look younger than ""Rang De Basanti"" or any other recent movie - nice acting too from everyone! Even the LA based Omi Vaidya has done a great job in his first Bollywood movie, as a geeky irritant.Do not miss it for anything!!!"
Best Movie,26 December 2014,10.0,"The best movie I have ever seen in the history of Indian Cinema. best Comedy, Little bit romantic, Story line was very awesome. The best part is the actor of the film is Aamir Khan, who is best for it. The starting of the film till the end Really Amazing. If i still watch it, it'll make me laugh out loud. Aamir khan the only actor who made such great films in Bollywood. Lagaan, Faana, sarfarosh, Dhoom 3, 3 Idiots And not Pk. PK is also the greatest movie of all time The Sound track of 3 idiots is awesome. I would rate it 9.5/10 'cause it is such an amazing film that can't be describe in words :) Thank Yew for reading my review"
Another Good Venture from Hirani,28 December 2009,7.0,"Well, three idiots is adopted from ""5 point someone"" novel by Chetan Bhagat and has been shot in IIM B'lore campus. I must admit that Mr. Hirani has come up with another good venture after Munna Bhai and its sequel.3 idiots illustrates the experiences of college life of 3 engineering friends. Unlike usual college comedies, this movie presents a fresh perspective with a message. Pre-interval part is totally hilarious and I can bet the comedy would roll you all in your seats. Just like MunnaBhai(s), Mr. Hirani has sought to bring forward a message through this movie. Therefore, though some instances post interval might appear out of line (must say a bit un-realistic) but viewers would like the overall movie.Aamir, as one of the protagonist, has been phenomenal in this movie as a college going student. Sharman, Madhvan and Boman Irani have also made very good contributions in the movie. Kareena looks good but her role is limited. Direction is good and the movie is set in the backdrop of Delhi.Its certainly worth one time watch.Hope you all enjoy this movie.Regards, MaDdyMacD"
Draggy Movie,1 January 2010,7.0,"Thankfully I drank coffee during the movie but ran out of m&m chocolates and was desperate to pass the time quicklyTo me a movie is an escapism from reality. I want to be thrilled and entertained. But '3 idiots' was reminding me of the reality and stating the obvious philosophies. It was predictable. Everything was so nice and cheesy. Oh hug me I hug you bullshits repeated over and over again. I love nice people and nice things happening BUT THATS IN REALITY. In the movie I wanted something different......End of the day, I had a sense of accomplishment for sitting through the entire movie."
The best Indian movie I've ever watched!,25 February 2018,2.0,"The review title said it all. Yeah, it's the best Indian movie of all time. It's totally great. The actors are great. The music, the actings and everything is great. It totally shows the education system of our country, Myanmar. That's why i love it. The movie shows the University life is fun and not stressed. A great film to spend your free time. 
As for me, I don't even remember how many times I've watched this movie. If you are searching for a great Indian movie, watch this one. Spending time in this film is totally worth it."
Really good,6 January 2020,2.0,"I remember watching this after me, my brother and my dad went to a video rental store (When they still existed) and we were picking a movie and we ended up with this one. We didn't really check the name properly and when we came home we felt like ""3 idiots"".Turns out that this movie was really good and we had a great evening watching it."
"Story, Acting, Drama - This film has it all",15 July 2022,9.0,"I love that it captures some harsh truth's about the Indian education system but manages to tell it through a hilarious epic story of these three friends (and the love interest, of course).I watched this film in theatres many years ago and it has remained my favourite Bollywood film of all time - thirteen years later.It is funny, dramatic, and captivating - and I have watched this film more times than I can count. Considering the length of the film, that's saying something."
Good,20 May 2022,9.0,Best movie.its one of the greatest movie you will ever see in your life. 100% movie.please watch it.It's amazing things. One of The best 5 movie in movie.
Not all is well.,16 November 2020,10.0,"This film is a mess. It mixed past with present time to tell a story. They completely ignore the most important questions like why Rancho has not contacted his friends in all these years, also why was Pia going marry ""ass"" again if she was proved that he's not worth it. Basicly this film completely ignores what the characters learned in the past and makes them do same mistakes only for the finale of the film for them to make the right choices again. Also this film likes to show many serious issues of the real world but then the next second it puts a terrible joke, so I could not take this film seriously at all. It's such a mess. It had many great ideas, the storyline is great, but it's just such a mess, it tries to mixes multiple genres at the same time which does not help."
One of the best film.....,28 September 2021,10.0,"Most of them don't live up to their hype, 3 idiots however deserves to be on that list 100%. This film has everything from a diverse cast, to a realistic respectful romance, to accurate and emotional portrayal of suicide and burdens parents put on their children to a well written strong and funny female character and last but not least an amazingly written main character who is played fantastically well. I had not heard of this film but am so I glad i found it! I laughed, I cried, I was utterly confused and i will not be forgetting this film anytime soon. To anyone who has not seen this film GO AND WATCH IT! You won't regret it."
It's good in parts but Okay as a whole.,20 September 2014,10.0,"It's good in parts but Okay as a whole. Aamir Khan this time comes up as an engineering student and does it not so convincingly. He seemed to have been through college not once but many times over, as he started telling 'Say your heart All is Well and things will fall into place'.The movie is about giving freedom to kids and a message to parents, let them be what they want to be do not enforce things on them. This is conveyed in a light sense and in a comical way. Yet, at times it becomes preachy, like the confrontation of Rancho with Virus where Rancho says 'Yeh Marks mere ko samajh aaye hi nahi' and yet not at many other times. It is a parody of itself take the black and white scenes of Raju's family or the scene of Chatur Lingam where he says that after 5 years lets see who will be where. But the good moments are far and only between as a few drizzles in a tropic summer.The cinematography is good only in parts. Like aerial shots of Shimla road and Ladakh scenes otherwise it was just good. The art designing is commendable with the look of college, hostel and other things done well. The editing was not precise as I thought there are lot of things that could have been cut out like the pregnancy sequence in climax. The casting was not apt except Boman Irani as Principal, Chatur Lingam guy the others were clearly not apt. The 3 main protagonists and the heroine were clearly a misfit as none seemed to be students. Acting was average as nothing was so great and so original as if it was never seen. Chatur Lingam was the silver lightning in the otherwise dry acting. Also to mention is Boman Irani as principal.The writing was mediocre as their previous ones were well written and witty Munnabhai movies. And this was an adaptation of Five Point Someone having read that, I can say that the whole backdrop and the characters and only a few situations were picked but the point that was told was different from the book. That book is much worse than this movie. I am not detailing any instances as mostly, I found them silly and stupid.And in parts, hardly a couple, the originality came out. The speech by Chatur Lingam is the saving grace otherwise it was merely pathetic but such instances took it to at least average level.All is surely not well and it's strictly Average - 2/5."
Awesome movie,30 August 2021,10.0,Movie with best story and drama. All the actors performed very well.
Wonderful,25 November 2021,10.0,"The structure of the film is absolutely wonderful. It teaches a lot of things for youngsters. It teaches to handle things calmly, thing practically. Overall its 10/10 for me."
Love the Movie,21 July 2021,10.0,This one was the best movie I would like to say. I love it.
what an amazing feelgood movie,19 February 2022,9.0,"What a wonderful time for me, to discover Bollywood cinema. This movie will open your heart. I'm stunned at how effortlessly the movie jumps from silly comedy to serious tragedy. ""3 Idiots"" always remains tasteful, even though the Idiots do some really idiotic things. And when it's funny, it is really laugh-out-lound-funny.Why is ""3 Idiots"" so special? Because it grips you completely. It is so colourful and beautifully filmed, the storytelling is really captivating and unusual. I loved the musical bits here and there. The characters are lovable and hilarious (Rancho, The professor at ICE, Silencer). The cliches somehow seem fresh (escaping the wedding with the bride). But more than this, it has a really powerful message about love, true friendship, family and dreams.I asked a waiter at an Indian restaurant to recommend me an Indian movie and he wrote this and 2 other names on a piece of paper. Really happy i saw this movie. It will stay with me."
One of the best movies ever made in the history of Indian cinema,24 December 2009,9.0,"AK and rajkumar hirani has changed the face on Hindi cinema in this millennium and century. after chal chalein, released this year, 3 idiots is another movie which dealt with the education system, students committing suicide after the results are announced and parents forcing on the students to fulfill their dreams. This movie will be an eye opener to the educationists and parents and I hope they will ask their children's to listen to their hearts and choose their career.I was always against the education system of RAATA culture.RDB team is back.

Very very good ...,21 January 2022,10.0,"This movie is a masterstroke that rivals 2021's 83, but falls just short. Even so, it is a very humorous and heartwarming tale that features an ALL STAR ensemble cast, incredible musical numbers/dance choreography, and elite level script writing. Definitely watch this over its cheap Spanish counterpart/ripoff ""3 Idiotas"", possibly the worst movie ever to be conceived by man. Would highly recommend. Aal izz well !!!!!!9/10

The most meaningful goofy movie.,1 November 2020,10.0,"Personal Rating: 7/10I want to keep this review brief, unlike the movie. I tease... though it does have a runtime of 2hr 50mins. However, that time passes by quickly, filled by a series of ""mini"" movies contributing to the overarching storyline of this film. But that's all beside the point.I went into this movie having not seen much Bollywood before, and thinking this was a twist on the 3 stooges. Boy was I in for a rollercoaster. I could tackle this movie as I usually do, dialogue, cinematography, set design, acting, and quality. If I did that, however, this movie would have a much lower rating. If I based my score off of how many people peed on a wall though... I want to acknowledge that this movie is old, many of the cuts and transitions are cheesy to the western world, most storylines were just there for the surprise, and some of the dialogue... ""not it chief.""But,that's not this movie. If you go in expecting Christopher Nolan you will surely leave disappointed. What makes this movie worth watching in my opinion, are the heavy topics, themes, that it covers in a comedic yet straightforward, not pulling punches, way. I don't want to give any spoilers but to name a view of the themes, the robotic flawed nature of the educational system, the issue of suicide caused by stress, parents pushing their dreams on their children, and pursuing things that make you happy. Just by that alone, Woah, this movie is gold. And the comedy, it's fun, keeps it a very enjoyable watch!Major props to the Indian filmmaking culture for making this gem.""All is well!"""
BEST INDIAN FILM EVER MADE,18 August 2023,6.0,"Three Idiots is a groundbreaking Bollywood hit that was released ahead of its time. This film is a comedy with great acting, unique characters, a complex plot, and, most importantly, a very inspiring film about choosing the correct route in life.The film's makers depicted some breathtaking views of Ladakh's rugged environment. These sequences were captured using a variety of camera angles, including high angle, crane, and parallax views. These bright images were cleverly employed to suggest that a pleasant and exciting event was on the way. I thought the video was highly informative in the manner it seeks to raise awareness and educate viewers about the rising danger of suicides in India's school system. The tone of the picture shifts quickly from joyful to sorrowful to funny, and so on. As a result, the picture became more exciting since I was continually on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what intriguing incident would unfold. I used to believe that all Bollywood films were low-budget and had bad performers, but I've since learned that some of their actors are very convincing, even by Hollywood standards! These acting talents have inspired me to watch more Bollywood films since they have shown me how exceptional they can be.Thank you."
Superb,8 July 2021,9.0,One of the best Bollywood movies ever . Every actor was good in their roles and the director have one a good job .
A Must Watch Movie,11 June 2021,9.0,3 Idiots is an awesome movie. Very relatable to all the students out of the world. Just loved it.😘😊
a good movie,21 December 2021,10.0,"3 Idiots is a comedy and inspirational film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. This film is based on our Indian educational system which pressurizes the students and has an obsession for high grades. Aamir Khan as Rancho plays the role of a very bright student who motivates his friends pursue their passion and make a career out of it. R. Madhavan as Farhan who wants to become a wildlife photographer but was forced to pursue engineering because of his strict father.Sharman Joshi as Raju who is pursuing engineering with the goal of getting his family out of extreme poverty. Boman Irani as virus who plays the role of a strict college director who is highly competitive. Kareena Kapoor as Pia who plays the role of virus's daughter and falls in love with Aamir khan. The film goes very smooth. The film's first half includes ragging scene, confrontations with the professor, Chatur's speech and mournful meal at Raju's home. Overall the film depicts a very nice mingle of comedy, suspense and motivational. All the actors and co-actors done a commendable job. The music of the film was very soothing. Some of the scenes are really emotional. Overall rating is excellent."
Not too well,20 November 2011,10.0,"I expected the world out of this movie. Aamir Khan is Only a half decent actor, but Rajkumar Hirani is the man behind the Munnabhai Series, two of the best films in the history of Hindi cinema. But how he disappoints!!! The problems with the movie are the fact that it is too long, has no idea what it is trying to preach. But the big big problem being the fact that it is so so unfunny. Really. The Munnabhai films made you smile and chuckle in almost every scene, but there is such a lack of genuinity in this film, that it gets very hard to do the same here. Maybe it is the poor acting skills, maybe it is the fact that Aamir Khan cannot carry the film well at all, I dunno. Mostly, it must have been my expectations I guess. NOTHING iz well here, don't even bother easting precious time on this. Wish I could rate this even lower, like a negative, but alas...."
Gem of a film,27 July 2022,10.0,"Would recommend to everyone. Inspirational, funny, romantic, and very applicable in todays society. It ticks all the boxes and is far better than any western movie I've seen."
All is well,9 October 2019,10.0,"It may be too long and corny at times, but it is nonetheless a funny, well acted and emotionally resonant movie with a good message.
All is well."
Couldn't let go of my couch and popcorn,3 April 2022,9.0,"3 Idiots is a 2009 Bollywood coming-of-age Dramedy movie, it's one of the best Bollywood movies until now. This movie is funny and heartfelt, it can be as dramatic as it's comedic, both equally effective, it also contains a little bit of romance so it makes it more exciting. This movie tells about the bads and goods of the education system in a university. It pressurizes the students and does not allow them to choose their destination by their own wish, in a harsh way. But in the other perspective, it also shows the brighter side of the friendship, how one can motivate and stand by his friend's side.Every single character was so well developed and had a role in that film which really affects the narrative. Every performance was top-notch. Seeing so many jokes the film uses, the possibility of getting the jokes too cheesy was high, but none did. The film balances its emotions so perfectly, I even shed a few tears in some places. Some tears of laughter, some tears of emotional damage.My favorite scene is when Rancho helps Mona give birth and for me, that scene is amazing because Rancho is not a doctor, but only with instructions through a video call from Pia, he can make it. He didn't just deliver Mona's baby, but built a vacuum extractor out of a vacuum cleaner and spare parts, to help the birth. Also, the scene when they met Rancho again. That was a very satisfying scene because they get to meet again after quite a long time. There we can see how Pia is so in love with Rancho that she ran away from her wedding just to search for Rancho. The funniest part is when Chatur found out that Rancho is Mr. Wangdu."
LOVE IT.,5 September 2021,9.0,"An inspiration for us engineers. A great movie of perseverance and to believe that ""Aal Iz Weell"" :D."
Hits hard and fast,6 November 2021,6.0,"I did not expect to get ""rocked on my chin"" so badly in this film. It has a pace as frenetic as MM: Fury Road, but, somehow, this rapid pace never interferes witb the poignant elements in the film. I suppose (one of the main motifs in the film) that the film moves through both happy and truly depressing/scarring moments alike is to try to mimic life; the happy moments are as brief as the awful moments, so just keep moving forward.From memory, the film reminds me of Dead Poets Society (which I find overly pretentious), but this film is done in a significantly more heartfelt and entertaining way.The characters are real, engrossing, and-often-hilarious. And the kinetic energy of some of the dance numbers is reminiscent of classics such as Singing in the Rain, etc.For various reasons, especially in the darker moments of this film, this is a film I needed to experience right now in this particular moment of my life. Certainly, the film's messages are most relatable to those under 30/35 (in actuality quite a few years younger). Regardless, from cinematography to character development to brilliant mastery of pace, this is a masterpiece."
Superb Movie,15 September 2021,6.0,I think all cinephile should watch this movie.....it's amazing.
3 hours too long,12 August 2011,10.0,"I rented this movie largely because of my love for Aamir and the rave reviews on here but in the event it was a disappointment.The film is crude and vulgar in parts. This is something I did not expect from Bollywood. I don't appreciate fart gags in UK/US movies and I certainly didn't like them here.Having 40-odd year old guys playing 18 year old students was somehow more ridiculous than normal --even for a Bollywood movie where, lets face it, reality is the least consideration.But what this film really confirmed to me was that Aamir is always surrounded by second rate actors. The frumpy girlfriend with glasses was as dreary as his two student buddies. There is no one to compete with him here. Other than Dil Chahta Hai, I've never seen him act in an ensemble. For the most part it is the Aamir show all the way. Yes, he's a fabulous actor but having him take center stage with zero competition does him no favors and makes for a boring 3 hours.Nope, sorry. I found the film a bore and I expected better."
comedy movie with message,30 August 2016,10.0,"The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's speech, the three some's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track. Aamir does it again. what a movie .from start to the end, hilarious moments.screenplay is fantastic. full on comedy and yet it never looses its heart. pulls off a 22 year old character with brilliance. never for once you feel you are watching. music looks OK"
This movie is an anomaly in the top 250 list,27 April 2020,6.0,This review is specifically for folks who are watching the 250 list. This movie doesn't deserve to be there. There is nothing special about the movie. You have been warned.
Bland,15 July 2020,6.0,"I really don't understand what's so great about this movie. The story, the plot, the characters, everything about it is very basic drama, with some cringe 'elementary school' comedy"
Good content,7 January 2022,4.0,Absolutely loved it. All is well. Motivates me to continue to have hope that all things are possible and with God on my side I have enough faith to believe that all is definitely well. Will ensure my kids watch this in future.
Best insipiration movie,8 May 2022,4.0,This movie is fabulous 👌 i watch this movie 100 time but whenever i watch this i can't stop laughing very good creation 😄 great acting by sharvan and amir khan and also r. Madhvan.
One of the best Bollywood movie of all time,20 June 2021,10.0,"This film is one of the unique film in the history of Bollywood. The execution of the story, shifting between past and present is really good. Even this film is comedy type, still I think you will learn many things from it.The story is about a college life of three idiots. Three friends have different dreams, financial support, culture but they are still connected by somehow which is amazing.I definitely recommend this movie to every college student. You not only feel entertaining but also able to learn many things from it, Thank you."
Movie Review,6 June 2022,9.0,One of my favorite movie. I saw it many many time. This movie give me different kind of feelings. This movie inspire me to learn any things by deeply.
The magic of Aamir Khan,26 December 2009,9.0,"With over six months of publicity, gossip, word of mouth, twitter updates, scandals, facebook applications, college debates and disappearing acts later finally Three Idiots released in theaters on the 25th of December 2009. Obviously, the first thought that comes to mind is, will the movie be up to snuff with the expectations it has created? Will i be happy with the comedy or is it going to be the few lines shown in the premiere? Is the movie going to be a typical Hindi film or something more?If i may?,i would like to stick my neck out and say that the movie was good. In that it satisfied my senses for the three hours that i was in the theater. As my friend put it, there was never a moment that our attention veered away from the screen. We never felt disconnected from the plot, never uninterested. The direction was beautiful, it was as if some brilliant student from college wanted to try something new and had brought in that fresh outlook. Also it was like a college graduate, as there was hardly an extra scene, the songs also told a tale and meant something. Cinematography, rarely do you see movies paying so much attention to detail. The lighting, the angles and the backdrop shots were great. I especially like the Pandong Lake scene, the tourism department could do with using shots like that and getting people to go to Ladakh. I am going in 2010. The acting in the movie was very free flowing, it didn't seem like there were any plastics in any of the scenes which is very refreshing. Boman Irani seemed a little repetitive with the whole Dr. Asthana acting in the movie but he kicked ass as an emotional dad. Kareena, Madhavan, Sharmaan were good in their supporting roles. Personally loved that Madhavan was the narrator.Aamir Khan - GeniusThe real hero in this movie is the well thought out plot and dialogue. The plot is going somewhere, has a direction and up to the last 20 minutes you do not really know where that is. Highlighting the current education system was worthwhile. Unfortunately the last 20 were a lot like a typical Hindi film, which is not always such a bad thing.All said and done, is this movie going to be viewed and appreciated by future generations? I hope so"
Evergreen,6 November 2021,6.0,All the favorite. One of my favourites. Whenever i watch this i feel connected with the story and I'm sure everyone feels the same. I cannot describe how i feel whenever I watch this masterpiece of raju amir sharman n madhvan.
"A satisfactory meal, but not the best...",29 December 2009,6.0,"The movie starts of well with excellent wit and moves along a pretty good pace that sets up the rest of the movie. 3 Idiots is all about 3 friends – Rancho, Raju and Farhan (Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and R Madhavan respectively) who have been accepted into a prestigious institute and set about to pursue their dreams.The three lead actors share excellent chemistry, along with the authoritarian principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani) and the ever competing bookworm Chatur Ramalingam (portrayed by Omi Vaidya) in an excellent role that gives life to the movie. The humor is pretty good in the movie. And the way the director has managed to intertwine both comedy and sentiments subtly is applaudable.Going to the negative aspects, I felt that some of the humor has been taken up shrewdly from the internet, the scenes which include Rancho pawning the campus director after his speech about his acclaimed astronaut pen, and then there's the scene where Rancho mixes up their exam papers among the pile of papers of other students. These jokes have been doing rounds on the internet for years now.Then there's the need to insert a love story into the movie in the most conventional way possible. The usual bollywood type love story, the girl (Pia played by Kareena Kapoor) doesn't like the guy at first. And then the hero manages to weave magic (Chamatkaar or Balatkaar, choose for yourself) around her which leaves her intoxicated enough to fall for our irresistible Rancho.Hirani also manages to push the limits a li'l far with some scenes, there is a scene wherein Rancho tries to extract a baby using a vacuum cleaner which he manages to assemble all and well within a few mins when our woman is in deep pain (literally), and then there is the succeeding scene where the baby isn't breathing. However, it comes to life when everyone starts chanting the tagline 'Aal izz well' (really???) The rest of the movie is well done which still makes it a full paisa vasool movie despite the flaws. Well written and most importantly surpassed by better acting by the actors who make up the movie. It would have been awesome if the the writer had managed to come up with some more original ideas. But still 3 idiots is one of the better Hindi cinemas this year. This is definitely not Hirani's best work, but one of the better one's indeed!!! There will always be talk about how movies aren't supposed to be taken too seriously, which is absolutely true. But in the end, its the feeling that you walk out with, that will define your contentment. If you read this review, you will find most of it is filled with negative aspects. The reason being, the rest of the movie is truly excellent, laced with sentiment and humor, which is a definite watch. Watch it!!"
Engaging Storyline,23 November 2023,10.0,"Aamir Khan's portrayal of the central character, Rancho, is both charismatic and emotionally resonant. His performance adds depth to the film and makes Rancho a memorable character. The film presents a compelling storyline that revolves around the pursuit of passion and knowledge rather than blindly following societal expectations. The narrative is well-crafted, balancing humor with thought-provoking themes.""3 Idiots"" is known for its humor and witty dialogues. The comedic elements, often delivered by the three lead characters, contribute to the film's overall entertainment value. The supporting cast, including R. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Kareena Kapoor, and Boman Irani, deliver noteworthy performances. The chemistry between the lead actors adds authenticity to the characters' friendships."
Full of Life Lessons,4 August 2021,10.0,"Even though parts of the movie can be a bit corny (it is a Bollywood movie after all), this is a pretty incredible movie that everyone should see. I west expecting a silly comedy, but this movie is full of valuable life lessons and heartfelt relationships instead."
Best Bollywood movie,25 September 2021,7.0,"It's a story of a three friends in a college and their life after college . It's very humorous, inspiring and funny at the same time . It will take you back to your student life and make you remember different good and bad aspect of it . It will make you realise how important friendship is and how it matters to an individual . It will guide you to realise how important it is to follow your heart rather than succumb to society pressure and follow the path you are not interested. You will get motivated , cry and believe me laugh at the same time . Go watch it , you won't regret and will definitely create a strong impact on your life . Cheers 😊"
Awesome,27 September 2021,7.0,A must watch movie. Great story and superb acting from actors.
Numero uno idiots!,26 December 2009,1.0,"Direction - outstanding, Script - excellent, Dialogues - Well written, Acting - 10 out of 10, Comedy - mind blowing, Emotions - great, Message - too good, (specially for Indian parents) Whatever else you find left out, add full marks from my side. Rajkumar Hirani's earlier movies - Munna Bhai series, were all exapmles well crafted arts. Which answers all the question about his caliber. I have also heard that script of Lage Raho being added to Academy's Library of scripts. By this movies he proves yet again what he can create. He is simply among one of the best directors present in the country today. RajKumar Hirani + Aamir Khan, upon a Chetan Bhagat's best selling novel and you will find - 3 idiots!. I loved the message most as it matches with the need for today. I remember myself being imposed the dream of becoming an engineer. It beautifully captures the emotions of such students and the pressure because of their family. Dialogues has simple words but at the same time well thought out ones and one of the few i loved was from the suicide scene - ""I Quit"" - least use of words and maximum results.One of Aamir's best ever!!A MUST WATCH FOR EVERYONE."
likable if bloated screwball comedy,14 July 2012,1.0,"When it comes to running-time, why does Bollywood treat every movie as if it were a sweeping historical epic on the order of a ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or a ""Doctor Zhivago?"" A case in point: ""3 Idiots,"" an amiable enough little screwball comedy that has been padded out to a wrist-slashing 164 minutes. It also happens to be the most commercially successful Bollywood feature ever released in India. Go figure.The story centers around a trio of promising but mischievous young engineering students who rebel against the high-pressured rigidity - both academic and personal - of the exclusive school they're attending.""3 Idiots"" has two things going for it: its cranked-up energy level and its appealing actors, especially Aamir Khan, who portrays the ringleader of the group. These alone are enough to compensate for the silliness of much of the action, the corniness of the jokes (with irritating cue music in case we couldn't pick up on the corn on our own) and the stickiness of the sentimentality. And, in its own playful way, the movie makes some important points about the intense pressure placed on Indian children to achieve beyond their parents' wildest expectations, and about the need to pursue the path that will make one most happy in life.It's a pretty entertaining feature, overall; I just wish it didn't take so darn long to play itself out."
Opinion,17 October 2017,10.0,Didn't find it an awesome film but a regular film. There's two perspectives I shall mention: first one isthat there's much drama involved and that's why i only rate it with 6 stars; however there's some laughing moments with funny scenes. The crew was a nice selection. The actors had a nice role. The involving ambient doesn't show people the reality of India.
Not an EPIC movie,11 May 2013,10.0,"Its been while that this movie is out. There are many better movies made in the Indian film industry which have a far better script and a story line than this movie. I was quite surprised to see this movie of IMDb 250 list, doesn't deserve it at all. Probably a movie like Lagaan or Jodha Akbar might have been a better choice over 3 Idiots which basically is for the younger generation and like most of the movies delivers a common message. I am not quite sure how it got 8.1..The most ridiculous part was the delivery of a baby using a vacuum cleaner, common people who are watching not dumb, can they point out a single instance. That scene almost ruined the movie. Overall, it is just an outright commercial movie for the youth and the masses, nothing fantastic."
Awesome,26 April 2022,8.0,The best movie I've ever seen! I rewatched many times and never bored. This movie gave me motivation to majoring Engineering in university. I love the soundtrack too.
Watch it atleast once in lifetime!,15 April 2022,8.0,It comprises of the perfect package of every ingredient required in a feature film. Well-written and also well made epic package for all kind of cinema lovers. Aamir khan justifies his role more than required and also becomes a proven example of what makes a man really successful in life. Seems fresh though its been years since I have seen the movie.
Amazing!!!,30 June 2021,10.0,"One of the best movies that I've ever seen! I've lost count of how many times I've watched this movie. Never felt bored while watching. Well written and directed by Rajkumar Hirani and the cast was also superb, especially Aamir Khan and Boman Irani."
What an Inspiring and Incredible Film,1 April 2022,10.0,"3 Idiots is a comedy-drama Bollywood film with a bit of a musical genre. The story starts with two friends, Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman), who misses their lost friend from college, Rancho (Aamir Khan). They have been searching for him since they graduated, but no one knows where he is. And one day, Chatur (Omi), a guy who hates Rancho in college, contacted them and stated that he knows where Rancho is. So the three of them set out on a journey to find their lost friend. The story is about a beautiful friendship of the 'three idiots' and a satire about the Indian education system at that time.My favorite scene of the film was when Farhan successfully convinced his father that he wanted to quit engineering and start his career as a photographer. At first, his father was angry at his decision. But after all the emotional conversations, he finally decides to support his son. And also the scene when Raju did his job interview. He answered all the questions straightforwardly. Then the interviewers stated that they would accept him if he changed his straightforward attitude. But Raju declined the offer. He said that he doesn't want to change himself. However, the interviewers found him interesting and unique, so he got accepted for the job. I found both scenes interesting because it's the start of their new journey. Raju finally comes out of his fear, and Farhan finally does what he loves. And after the scenes, they both pay respect to Rancho, which is very emotional and heart-warming.For me, this movie is like a full-course meal. You could get all types of emotions with this film. I could feel happiness, sadness, anger, and other emotions just by watching it. I also love how they brought up serious issues, such as social pressure, depression, mental illness, suicide, the education system, etc. Rajkumar Hirani, the director of this film, did an amazing job by covering all of those issues in one film. This movie has two timelines in the plot. But you never really get confused by it because it is very organized. The movie is also very well-paced and entertaining. Although it is an almost-3 hours long movie, it didn't feel so long and was not boring at all. The actor and actresses also did a great job nailing their roles. The soundtrack in the film suits well in each of the scenes.3 Idiots is such a 10/10 film for me, because of the story itself. All the details in the movie successfully complemented the story. The message they were trying to give us is delivered very well. This movie told us to follow our passion, fight our fears, to remember our friends who fought with us from the beginning, and also to cherish every moment of our life because it all will become memories."
Am I missing something this movie is mediocre and waaayy to long,19 September 2019,9.0,"Is it worth watching, short answer no. Is it worth watching if you are a fan of Bollywood, I guess. Is this movie anywhere near the 8.2 The world of IMDbers have given it no way. The acting is mediocre, the laughs are just ok, the obligatory dance sequences leave this American scratching his head. The length at almost 3 hours is way too long for a movie of this sort. And the hero, is well kind of a jerk not a loveable rebel (a quality I usually love to see). And there is way too much predictability in the plot. I dont watch very much Indian cinema, my favorite Indian flick is monsoon wedding, now that was a great film. This was mediocre on a good day."
