# Unlocking Viewer Insights: Leveraging Reviews and Ratings to Propel Movie Success


The project aims to analyze IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes (RT) datasets, supplemented with new user review data collected from IMDb, to understand the impact of viewer insights on movie success.

The analysis reveals a significant correlation between user ratings and movie success and identifies the influence of user sentiment on viewership. Key findings include:
- Ratings and Revenue: Both IMDb audience and professional ratings show a positive correlation with gross revenue, suggesting that higher ratings can predict financial success.
- Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment from user reviews impacts movie reception. Positive sentiments are linked to higher viewership and can be leveraged in marketing strategies.
- Viewer Insights for Marketing: The data suggests that understanding viewer sentiment and ratings can help tailor marketing strategies to enhance movie success and viewer engagement.


Based on the analysis, production firms can benefit by leveraging positive user sentiments in promotional activities, addressing negative feedback to improve future projects, and using detailed content analysis to align movie elements with audience preferences. These strategies are designed to enhance engagement and optimize marketing efforts for better reception and success of movies.

## Background
In the dynamic landscape of the film industry, production companies' strategic decisions are increasingly influenced by audience awareness and critical reception.  This study investigates how these factors shape the varying reception of films across diverse audiences and influential platforms.

By analyzing datasets from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, this research focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) that offer both qualitative and quantitative measures of success. These KPIs encompass box office performance, audience and critic ratings, and engagement metrics such as review volume and user interactions.  Through an examination of these KPIs, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of each film's reception and its implications for future productions.
