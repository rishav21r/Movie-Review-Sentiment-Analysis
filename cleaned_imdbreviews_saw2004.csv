I wasn't expecting this!,12 October 2022,8.0,"I watched some of the next movies before this. I wasn't expecting this one can be this good!There was some minor flaws in it but the story was really good overall with it's effective twist and all. Amazing editing, scores and sound by the way.I believe this is not just an ordinary horror movie, it's also a really great crime movie.Even if the movie wasn't that good at most, the ending would save it, the ending is so perfect with that ""Hello Zepp"" score. That music makes the scene two times better.If I had to mention the minor flaws, here is one example. I don't know why the car parking and all the other areas so dark and feels abandoned? I know, It's because this is a horror movie and the movie tries to scare you. But it's a bit much actually."
The First Great Franchise of the Twenty-First Century,21 February 2010,8.0,"Two seemingly unrelated people (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whinnell) wake up in a secluded, dingy bathroom, chained to the wall. With nothing but their wits, a few clues, and a hacksaw, they must figure out who put them in their predicament and how to get out. Well, assuming they're able to get out. For an added bonus, one of the men has a kidnapped family on the outside.Falsely categorized as ""torture porn"" (the violence and gore here are more in line with ""Seven"" than ""Hostel""), this film was the first smart horror film of the 2000s. Intelligent horror fans not only got the blood they wanted, but a clever villain and a mystery to solve. Later sequels would get more complicated than episodes of ""Lost"", and the series loses something as it goes (all franchises do), but this original stands as one of the modern greats. And, luckily, you can watch it without any of the sequels and it makes sense.There has been an effort in recent years to academically analyze ""Saw"", injecting a false connotation on to the film. One scholarly article points to the ""militarization"" of Jigsaw in a post-9/11 world. Jigsaw, like the military, carries out violent acts, but has found ways to rationalize them with moral justifications (saving the worthy, letting the undeserving die). The author makes various other parallels about a ""military"" setting, mentioning IEDs and the industrial setting of Jigsaw's workshop. I find this to be largely silly, and not at all the creators' intention. I see a much more obvious line of progression from ""Silence of the Lambs"" to ""Seven"" to ""Saw"" with the advent of the brilliant, self-moralizing serial killer. Even Hitchcock's ""Rope"" offered a justification for murder, albeit a poor one. Terrorism or not, the horror film will go on.You can make complaints, sure. But for young writers and directors, this was a blockbuster and deserved the massive success it got. As someone who pays close attention to a film's writing and plot, I was stunned. My only real concern is at the very end, when the key's location is revealed. I can't discuss this in a review, but let's just say I found that to be uncharacteristic and unfair of the killer.If you haven't seen ""Saw"" yet, see it. And see the second film. After that, they start to go downhill. But the first two are quite good and must-see viewing for all horror fans."
The game begins,3 November 2008,9.0,"Not since Se7en's John Doe has there been a serial killer with such a bizarre philosophy behind his actions (not that Jigsaw actually kills anyone; more on that later). Sure, in light of the increasingly deteriorating sequels it's hard to think of Saw as little more than a franchise- starter (something the writer and director never planned), but viewed on its own, astonishing merits, it's a good, nasty thriller, filled with solid scares and (especially compared to the follow-ups) quite well written.According to the film's notorious back-story, it took only 28 days to shoot it. Not that strange, given most of the action takes place in just two locations: one is a bathroom where Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) fins themselves with their feet chained to the wall, with no recollection whatsoever of how the hell they got there; the other is the lair of the mysterious Jigsaw, a serial killer whom Detectives Sing (Ken Leung) and Trapp (Danny Glover) have been tracking down for weeks.The two facts are linked in a most ingenious way: Jigsaw doesn't really kill anyone, but ""plays a game"" with his victims. In the case of Adam and Dr. Gordon, as the tape recorder found in a dead man's hand tells them, each of them has two hours to free himself and kill the other, or they will both die. Problem is, the only way to get rid of the chains is to saw your foot off. And so, while the two unfortunate cell-mates have to choose who gets to live (that's Jigsaw's perverse logic: he offers you a choice), the police close in on the elusive psycho, whose previous deeds and MO are shown in flashbacks.Whereas the subsequent Saw films use the messy chronology just for the hell of it (though they do get away with some neat narrative tweaks thanks to it), the first installment takes advantage of its non-linear storytelling to increase the suspense and provide some valuable clues to how everything fits together. It is to James Wan and co-writer Whannell's eternal credit that they, like Se7en writer Andrew Kevin Walker, went beyond slasher clich√©s and came up with something more. Okay, so Saw's philosophical undertones aren't entirely original, but what the heck, they do manage to keep the audience interested in what's going on. In addition, adding a little more depth to the killer ensures that the movie's more gruesome parts (and there are a lot of them) don't come off as gratuitous bloodletting (for an example of the latter, look no further than the countless sequels to A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday 13th).Furthermore, the intelligence behind the film's structure might also have had a positive effect on the performances, given the acting is more convincing here than in most post-2000 shockers: Elwes and Whannell's desperation is conveyed with an intensity that's almost too painful to behold, Glover plays the aging cop role resisting the temptation to do a Lethal Weapon in-joke (you know, the ""too old for this sh*t"" gag) and when Jigsaw himself appears... well, it's the horror equivalent of Keyser Soze - chilling and impossible to forget (and, for once, not played by Kevin Spacey). Just like the movie."
"Two strangers mysteriously wake up to find themselves in a derelict basement. Together, they find out how to escape, and if they are really strangers...",9 November 2005,9.0,"I have utmost respect for Wan. To my knowledge, he and his buddies were right out of film school. Instead of slowly building status by making mediocre films, he showed the world right from the get-go that he had something to prove.Along with Silence Of The Lambs, Saw is the only horror movie that truly chills me. You see, I am not easily frightened by gratuitous bloodshed and screams that you might see in films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The plot has to be coherent, and there can't be anything ridiculous like a monster. Saw evokes strong emotions of terror and fear, all the while remaining plausible. Well, the story is actually unlikely, but everything in the film is physically possible.The scenes that are meant to be frightening don't require things that jump out at you every two seconds, or cheesy orchestral flailings. The situation is what frightens you, not the presentation. Saw does have some second-rate acting, but then again it is a low-budget film and I suppose they couldn't exactly afford Robert De Niro. The script is not fantastic, but one true redeeming quality of the whole film is the story. It is dense, complex, but so captivating. I can only think of a few mystery plot lines that can even compare to this one. The Usual Suspects is probably up there, but Saw stands alone.I strongly recommend this film who appreciate good stories, and aren't easily scared by the garbage you see in theaters like House Of Wax. For people who get squeamish, steer clear of this film. It is very nice graphic, and very sadistic at times. A brilliant debut, and a terrifying ride. 9/10."
Tastefully done,12 August 2021,9.0,"I was always terrified to watch this movie because I thought it would be over the top blood and gore. I finally found the nerve and was extremely surprised. Unlike other horror movies this one takes in the entire scene of the detectives trying to catch the murder while you're trying to figure out what is going on. Even though the movie keeps flashing back it helps take some intensity off of what's going on and adds a nice story to it. Instead of a meaningless film with blood and gore, this one had a well thought out storyline and a killer with rules. It reminded me a little of Silence of the lambs, they both have that edge that anything brutal and gory can happen any moment keeping up the intensity of the film. Don't get me wrong there is blood and gore in the film, but it's done in a tasteful way unlike some of the final destination movies."
"The first, the best!",2 February 2011,9.0,"Okay, i have seen a lot of horror films. Saw was another one that i liked much. Saw 2,3,4...and so on were movies i disliked. The splatter was increasing for no apparent reason, the atmosphere and the whole set up and the feeling, that made the first a success, were all missing from the rest.So here we are. I review the first one that is the best in my opinion. I liked it. A friend of mine, a co-student at College, told me to watch the movie together. She couldn't remember how many times she had seen it. It was her favorite so she wanted to share it with me.I liked the flow of the movie. And then the movie ended. And i found my jaw fallen on the floor. Incredible movie. No i wont spoil you anything!!! Go and watch it!Warning though, it has extreme violence. I was about to eat something, while i was watching Saw. I reconsidered. I paused... i ate... then i watched the film."
"Nice idea, some nice surprises, large potholes...",2 May 2009,9.0,"Only read this if you've already seen the movie!Just two things to add to my heading:Bad bad makeup job on Cary Elwes. Definitely not ""as you (read:I) wish""...;-)The biggest laugh (really, I think moviegoers are so often much smarter than movie makers....;-)): At the end, the mobile is ringing, he's reaching, reaching, but no, just cannot touch or grab the phone ---then: tada! - OK, I'll take the saw (get it?? get it??) and cut my foot off. The saw is the regular garden variety type, not a very big one, but BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE REACHED AND SHOVED OVER THE MOBILE PHONE!!! Geez, that was SO bad, it really made me angry while laughing...I hope I'm not the only person to have noticed that, but just in case no-one has....;-)"
Takashi Miike and Giallo Films Channeled by way of David Fincher,7 March 2005,9.0,"Once the extremely improbable ending comes any viewer will feel sucker-punched in what I believe resembles any David Fincher film, most notably SE7EN, with a Takashi Miike spin. Which doesn't detract that for the most part it's claustrophobic, depressing, bleak, and filled with a growing sense of stomach-turning dread as the omnipresence of an unseen killer comes through, making us known anyone could be killed at any given moment, if his plans are not carried out to his satisfaction. Plans that largely include doing something unspeakable to solve a puzzle and thus, be set free.The problem with SAW its in the script itself, with plot holes galore, and character motivations/reactions completely unclear. The two main characters undergo the suffering victims are meant to and do so down to the end, but the supporting characters fair poorly. Danny Glover's character goes through being a broken man through the death of his partner to being badly obsessed with the Jigsaw Killer, and not once could I believe he would do most of the things he does throughout the film, like not requesting backup as he enters a deserted warehouse (in a flashback sequence), or allowing a clearly wimpy killer to get the best of him later on. Monica Potter plays Cary Elwes' wife who witnesses the killer point a gun to her daughter's temple while listening to her frantic heartbeats, but when she gets the chance to give him his just desserts she fails to do so because she was on the phone with her imprisoned husband. (It was a ""Huh?"" moment where motherhood somehow didn't enter into the plot logic, but then again, not many did.)Another thing which works against it is the fact that that for a genuinely interesting and even innovative premise like this one, SAW would be best as a film 20 - 30 minutes shorter with an equally shorter time span (the plot extends for an approximate five hours from start to climax), and then would the shocking twist at the end make some sense. As it is, it has the look and feel of a video game in which the menacing growl of a voice orders the victims through audio/videotape to commit a horrible and nearly impossible act in order to survive, with some rapid-fire MTV editing to add to the viewer's disorientation and Giallo overtones (which do work here if you think of Dario Argento's PROFONDO ROSSO or Mario Bava's BLOOD AND BLACK LACE). Here's hoping James Wan will make a much better film as he does have an overall good technique with his visuals."
A Heritage Damaged,16 June 2013,9.0,"Two men wake up in an empty room and finds themselves being manipulated in to playing a sadistic game by a mysterious character called JigsawLooking at the above short summary you can how easy it is to pitch to the Hollywood studios . Yes I know SAW started out as an Australian short film by director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell but even so the premise alone is enough to intrigue the most cynical studio boss and make them want to develop it in to a feature length movie . It's easy to forget but the original SAW was marketed as a smart thriller with a twist ending and certainly my own reaction on seeing it was "" Wow I never expected that "" . This was very much an era inspired by THE SIXTH SENSE where films sometimes liked to surprise an audience . Despite the often graphic violence seen in this movie it's the shock twist at the end that led to the film gaining very good word of mouth on its initial release The problem is that once you know the twist ending it doesn't really stand up to repeat viewings . Worse than that the original SAW's reputation has been greatly damaged by the large amount of sequels that followed it . None of them really concerned themselves with cerebral plotting and most of them concerned themselves with a function of continuity that would see yet another sequel set up . Perhaps worst of all each sequel tried to out do its predecessor by the amount of gore on offer . Indeed the phrase "" Torture porn "" became more and more increasingly used with the franchise and it's difficult to defend the later films from this which lurched from one gory set piece to another featuring a terrified victim suffering a cruel and graphic death SAW was a film that succeeded as a gory mainstream thriller when it was released in 2004 . It's easy to dismiss it just another horror film but that's to ignore and sadly forget that it had a market outside the normal teen horror crowd . It's also a film that suffers from having a franchise started after it which has damaged its heritage"
Disappointing,23 January 2005,9.0,"I have to give this movie a 4 because of a couple of things.1. What I'll call the ""stupid victim syndrome"". If you have the killer on the floor and you have his gun - shoot him please. If you are a cop and you have your shotgun pointed at the killer's back - shoot him please.2. When you are in a high stress situation and you have your finger on the trigger of a gun - your first instinct is to squeeze. This is one of the first things they teach you in handgun training and the reason that you don't put your finger on the trigger until you are ready to fire - ask any hunter or infantryman. If you are electrocuted, your muscles should also contract - making you squeeze your finger.3. It's really hard to lay on the floor completely still for 8 hours without 2 other people - one of them a doctor - not noticing that you aren't dead. Even more so if you are supposedly dying of a brain tumor and were in the hospital just a few months earlier.4. Technically, the killer did kill one of his victims - the guy he injected with poison that had to get the antidote. If you poison someone, that is murder.5. What was Adam's lesson that he was supposed to learn? Yes, the doctor needed to be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something.Other than those things, I would have given this movie a higher grade. The plot was pretty good, and the ways the killer chose to kill his victims were very inventive. I can even forgive the terrible acting on the doctor's part - the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick. The cinematography and soundtrack were very good, but the ending seemed contrived and just didn't work for me. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay to see this or I would have demanded a refund."
Don't confuse this movie for its sequels- this one's actually good,27 March 2020,7.0,"The Saw movies tend to get a pretty bad rap. Most people think of them as senselessly violent and overly gory torture fests with no actual interesting plots or characters. Granted, some of the movies are like that. But, when you watch this 2004 original, leave those expectations at the door, because this movie is just a genuinely good thriller and mystery.This movie has an intriguing premise of two strangers waking up in a room, handcuffed to pipes. As the move progresses, this mystery unfolds as we learn more and more about these two characters and about the situation that they are in. There are many twists and turns as the movie unfolds, but they never feel forced. These twists feel organic and are truly shocking. Because of this, I don't think of this movie really as a horror movie. It feels more like a mystery thriller, and it draws you into its premise. However, it is a very tense movie and there are some frightening scenes, so it does succeed as a horror movie as well.If gore is the main thing keeping you from watching this movie, I would give it a try. Granted, there is gore in this movie, but it's not nearly as much as you would expect from a movie these days with Saw in the name. The gore is never intrusive or over-the-top, and it certainly is never meant to be the point of the movie. If you cannot watch gore at all, there may be a couple of scenes where you'll want to close your eyes, but there is still so much to enjoy from this movie outside of those moments."
"Sicko movie, Go!",31 January 2005,7.0,"A sicko movie whose nastiness is almost topped by its weirdness...so obviously any true horror fan worth their salt needs to seek it out! The story is about a surgeon and a photographer who wake up and to find themselves shackled at opposite ends of a nasty-looking toilet. Don't want to say too much but plenty of ugliness ensues. This movie has the perfect mix of scares and a really bizarre plot. The movie's got a decent budget for an indie horror (a little over a million, i think) but it's pretty small for a film that got such a big release. I hear it made a ""killing"" at the box office, so TAKE NOTICE Hollywood! People want to see this stuff. Go!"
I +Saw+ it last night,11 June 2005,8.0,"""Saw,"" a film that was originally planned for a straight-to-video release but after receiving positive nods at test screenings, was finally given the green light in October 2004 - just in time for Halloween. ""Saw"" contains one of the those plots that shows you everything it's got up its sleeve, then doubles-back on itself three-fourths of the way through and reveals something entirely new.It's not hard to see why this almost hit the straight-to-video fodder list. I mean, people will closely observe that it obviously contains the traits of its successors, namely ""Seven"" (1995), and that may be all the ammunition the haters will need to trash it. Already, I see that the IMDb voters have averaged ""Saw"" a 7.5, with those people who have rated it with an ""8"" or a ""10"" being neck-and-neck at the polls.But I begin with reassurances that ""Saw"" is a genius thriller, if not entirely original or daring. The film does its best to exploit the claustrophobia and mounting tension that collects as it progresses. ""Saw"" will also make you think twice about bladed objects as well.Ironically, the title has very little to do with plot, as there is no chainsaw-wielding maniac on the loose as the ghastly cover art of a severed foot would imply. The only saws here are the ones the two main characters Lawrence (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell, also the film' screenwriter) have been given.The two men awaken to find themselves chained to lead pipes in a decrepit public bathroom. In the middle of the floor, is a dead body that's surrounded in a pool of its own blood, with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. As it would turn out, they're the latest victims of a serial killer known as the ""Jigsaw Killer.""Jigsaw has a nasty little way of torturing his victims by trapping them in a situation where they have to kill if they want to survive. As Lawrence explains, technically Jigsaw is not a killer, simply because he hasn't killed anyone; the victims do that for him. As one fortunate victim observes, who survived her ordeal, she is bound to a chair with a reversed bear trap-like device strapped to her head with pliers wired into her upper and lower jaws. A timer is on the device and if she does not locate a key before it runs out, her mouth will be ripped open and no more pretty face. In order to get out, she must open up the stomach of a dead man lying on the floor next her to get the key.As Jigsaw ever so carefully points out to his victims, he doesn't just choose them at random. To him, they're all perfectly immoral individuals and he uses their immorality to set up horrific situations where the victim rarely survives the trap; in essence, life is its own reward because Jigsaw's victims don't value it, as he explains to the one young woman lucky enough to fight through his plan. Also on the case of Jigsaw, are two detectives Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung), who bring forth the news of Jigsaw's previous victims in one particularly gruesome flashback sequence.Lawrence is pretty well aware of the case of Jigsaw, as even once he was considered a suspect by the police. As you would have it, Adam is not especially trustful of Lawrence being that he seems to know a lot and is not reporting many details to him. They realize, however, that if they are going to survive this nightmare, they're going to have to play into Jigsaw's game, observe the clues he's willing to give them, and ultimately make it out alive.""Saw"" was directed admirably by James Wan and written by Whannell, who also makes an effective victim alongside Elwes. Elwes, a highly underrated actor, is given a chance to shine here, even though this really isn't an actor's movie, as it is more in the hands of the director. However, we do get a sense of the desperation of the two leads, who soon realize that they're not the only ones trapped in this madman's game.""Saw"" does benefit from its moody atmosphere, which may cover up any of the film's shortcomings. Towards the end, it does lose pace a little bit as things seem to be spiraling down the haunted house route, but quickly regains momentum as it draws to a close. I know that despite its flaws, I was glued to the seat and really ""in"" the film's tight tension, which thankfully doesn't let up.Is ""Saw"" a genre classic? Certainly. Is it a classic like ""Seven""? I don't know. There's a lot to consider when pondering a question with so much baggage like that one. I liked it, but I'm not so sure about the news that a sequel is in the works. This seems a lot like a stand-alone-type movie, that of which doesn't need to get bogged down by the weight of unnecessary sequels.8/10"
Very good,13 October 2021,8.0,"This movie is a very good and one of the best thrillers and one of the most interesting and tense ones. Very unique story line and extremely tense and entertaining, it kept me guessing what is going on and how are things going to go. Very well done story and directing, good acting, great effects, and a great twist. Very well done and entertaining."
A puzzling game worth playing,24 November 2017,7.0,"Finally saw all the 'Saw' films prior to seeing 'Jigsaw' (as part of my wanting to see as many 2017 films as possible this year, during a quieter and less intensive period). Heard a lot about the films, good and bad, but wanted to see them for myself to know what to expect.The films as an overall series are a very mixed bag. The first 'Saw' is very problematic but is one of the better films of the 'Saw' series. It is very easy to see why people will dislike it, and no it is not because of the full throttle horror-like elements that are not for the faint hearted. Some of the story is ridiculous with large lapses in logic, Danny Glover's character's actions will have one screaming in frustration at the television screen. Some of the script is tight, other parts are half-baked and silly and Elwes' character's back-story had some taut tension but that it had some melodramatic parts with frustrating character behaviour.Some of the acting is not good. Cary Elwes seems to be thinking like he's acting in a very over-heated melodrama that would have been out of date even in the period when they were in fashion. Danny Glover's performance is also a mess, with a mix of over-compensating and not looking interested. Even for the film's mood, some of the editing is chaotic.However, for a film that didn't have a high budget 'Saw' visually doesn't look too bad on the whole, effective even. There is a real sense of unsettling claustrophobia induced in the lighting, setting and photography. Music has its eeriness.Not everybody fares badly in the acting. Michael Emerson has an unnerving presence and Monica Potter and Leigh Whannell also do a decent job. Then there is Tobin Bell, not easy to forget him after this film. James Wan does more than competently in the director's chair, even with the inexperience.Despite its ridiculousness, the story is also edge-of-your-seat and highly atmospheric. There is genuine dread, some truly imaginative traps and kills and much of it throughout is disturbing and creepy. 'Saw' is notable in particular not just for the traps/kills but also for its bold twists, the character of Jigsaw (the modus operandi, impulse and justification setting him apart from most characters of his type) and an unforgettably shocking ending.Overall, very problematic but effective. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
BRILLIANT,23 October 2018,7.0,"I love this movie man. I just love everything about it. Not only does this movie create an extremely tense atmosphere from start to end, it has plenty of gore and violence to bombard your eyes, not to mention that ENDING. Man I LOVE that ending. With unknown actors and they all did and incredible job acting in these types of situations. This film was, in my opinion, exciting, thrilling, and an overall entertaining film to watch. It delivered the necessary chills, to keep its audiences fully awake, and engaged. This was an enormous achievement for both James Wan, and Leigh Wannell. The two have created a well-deserved horror/thriller, without the necessary cliches. The film is incredible and it start from Saw 2,3,4,5,6, Final Chapter, Jigsaw, and now in 2020 Spiral. I don't care what anyone says Saw is the best of the series and the best horror movie ever. 10/10. Love it."
Unlikelihoods,22 October 2005,10.0,"The main problems of 'Saw' are related to the tremendous script mistakes that only a uncritical spectator will just obviate. The main question is what's is the purpose of the killer in his lying in the middle of the floor? The film tries to show that the killer's aim is to cause evil and destruction in his victims, he loves to play with the lives of other people and to feel control over their the fears and debilities. So why does he just pretend to be dead between the two main characters? A tremendous unlikelihood: can a man pretend to be dead for more than one or two hours without moving a single muscle or even without breathing in order not to be discovered by two men who are in the same room? It has not sense at all except to be the final (d)effect of the movie. The killer seems to have always the control along the plot and if it's lying like a dead body this can't be possible. Finally, it doesn't work. The right place for the killer should have been a darker and untouchable shadow behind the false shadow (the male nurse) but not the floor of the white room. The director shouldn't have showed the killer's face and maybe the site where he is hidden. Then, the film would be a quite good thriller. However, 'Saw' is just a fiasco. Hitchcock, please, come back."
I loved it,10 February 2005,10.0,"Movies like Saw are the ones that makes us believe in the horror genre. It is because of such movies we like to see horror/thriller movies. Let me tell you that after watching Saw I wanted to buy the ticket and watch it again because after a long time I got to see a real gripping and tightly directed horror movie. The movie is very exciting and has a lot of goosebumps. However, if you are a faint of heart please do not see this movie as it has a lot of gore/violence in it which will make you jump out of your seat. I just can't wait for the DVD to come out as I really want to buy it. My recommendation to all of you is to watch Saw and have a good time like I did. Also, the movie has a great twist. 10/10"
An Ending You Will Not See Coming!,6 May 2020,10.0,"My favorite franchise of all time...
Starts out with two regular Joes stuck in a random grousome room. Movie gradually becomes exponentially more interesting as the plot unfolds, leading to (in my opinion) the most interesting serial killer of all time. One really frightening scare and phenomenal acting."
Saw (2004),13 March 2005,10.0,"A delightful little horror/thriller, whichever you like, with an interesting set-up. Two men wake up in a bathroom, chained to pipes, with a dead body between them. The two then work on a way of getting out of their, while one of them recalls an investigation from five months ago. Some of the ideas in this film are morbidly brilliant, such as the ways in which the killed ""kills"" his victims. The razor wire, and the combination on the safe being two priceless moments. You may have already noticed however that this film borrows heavily from ""Se7en"", with original ways of killing victims, the whole purification of the victims, a scene where two cops nearly catch the killer and the overall dark and macabre feel. This is in no way an insult towards the film, as it does have enough originality to keep you interested, and if you are going to borrow from any dark serial killer thriller, make it ""Se7en"". Cary Elwes and newcomer Leigh Whannell are the two unfortunate souls stuck in the khazi together, and start off suspicious of one another and then forming a rather endearing bond. Things get a bit too intense for Elwes at the end, meaning he loses all rational thought, and starts screaming and shouting but with a high level of authenticity making the film very almost 'moving'. Some characters seem pointless in the film, and a lot of situations are shoved in purely for red herrings sake. Some of the actors are just underused, such as Danny Glover, which is a shame because apart from his character being pointless, he is very good. The film is good for at least a few watches, the first racking your brain to work everything out, the second to see what you missed and even after that it is still enjoyable. Do not expect anything too different, but with a little low budget class. Wan is a brilliant first time director, never showing too much (could blame the budget) gore, and keeping the tension high. He dos however give in to some music video techniques with spinning cameras, screaming heavy metal, and sped up footage. We can ignore this though, because we just want a dark, spooky and bizarre horror with more than a few memorable set-ups."
One of the Most Unique and Grisly Thrillers In Recent Memory.,11 December 2004,10.0,"""Saw"" is one of the better horror films in recent memory. I suppose it's more of a thriller than horror, although it still is gory and serves well on a horrific level. It's sort of a cross between ""Se7en"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" I'd say, and the film is pretty damn good. ""Saw"" opens with two men who wake up in a dilapidated public restroom with no memory of how or why they are where they are. Chained to the floor, they are both utterly confused and terrified. Together, they begin to piece together the memory of what happened to them as the serial killer, nicknamed Jigsaw threatens them and plays numerous mind games that lead up to their demise. Meanwhile, detectives and officials are on the trail of the brutal serial murderer, trying to save the men the entire time.This is definitely a smart thriller and it will have you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning to the bloody, limb-severing conclusion. The characters are extremely believable and the acting was great, including performances by Carey Elwes, Monica Potter, and Danny Glover. Everyone performed perfectly and were very believable to watch. The entire movie has a dark, damp setting, and is overloaded with intense scenes and lots of gore, that are sure to please any horror fan. On top of that, the cleverly-woven story is unique and underived. James Wan does an excellent job, especially considering this to be his first feature film. I can't wait to see some his future stuff.Bottom line - ""Saw"" is a smart, grisly, unforgiving, all-around brutal horror movie that is unique and original. If you are looking for a horror movie a notch above your average slasher flick, I advise you see ""Saw"". 9/10."
love this movie,1 July 2021,7.0,When this came out there was not really anything like it and the ending was just nuts when Tobin Bell stands up OMG my jaw hit the ground the 1st time i saw this.
Original terror movie that originates a successful franchise,20 July 2009,7.0,"Two men(Cary Elwes, Leigh Whannell also screenwriter) wake up in a dirty bathroom tied by their ankles to pipes. Between them appears a dead man , near lies a tape-player and a pistol. Both play some tapes which find in their pockets. One must murder the other or his wife and daughter will die. Meanwhile Detectives(Danny Glover,Ken Leung, Dina Meyer) and another people must avoid deadly traps that a sinister character has set on the way.This exciting terror movie contains horror, suspense, thrills, chills and lots of blood and gore . The picture takes accent on tension as well as a well-knit script full of twists and turns.It packs eerie images-shock , slick edition and nail-biting pace. The movie is well starred by Tobin Bell, a support actor working in television and cinema from the 80s. Frightening and stirring musical score by Charlie Clousier and colorful cinematography by David Armstrong, both of whom are usual of franchise. The motion picture is stunningly directed by James Wan.It's followed by Saw II by Darren Lynn Bowman with Glenn Plummer , Enmanuel Vaugier, Donnie Wahlberg; Saw III by Darren Bowman ; Saw IV ; Saw V and in -production Saw VI, repeating similar players as Betty Russell, Shawnee Smith, Costas Mandaylor and of course Tobin Bell."
Finally a B-grade horror film that scares and surprises! Great stuff,9 December 2004,9.0,"Two men awake in a white-tiled fluorescent-lit room, chained to opposite walls, a dead body between them. The only clue as to how they got there is a recorded message. Gradually they realize they have been targeted by serial killer Mr Jigsaw.What's interesting about Mr Jigsaw is that he's the kind of crazy who likes to teach his victims lessons and test their intelligence. Although there's not a lot of gore in this relatively unusual hybrid of psychological thriller and horror, Saw is genuinely terrifying in moments, and merely stressful the rest of the time. The wire jaw lock is particularly memorable. The uneven acting of the cast ¬ñ Cary Elwes is particularly overblown ¬ñ doesn't detract, it just makes Saw more of a B-film indulgence.Director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell (who also stars), both from Melbourne, have scored an international hit with this film, which went to No. 1 at the UK box office and to No. 3 in the USA. A sequel has been announced for 2005.Even if you're not easily scared, don't see Saw alone, particularly at night. ***1/2/*****"
Poor,23 April 2005,9.0,"So I just watched this movie (I won't even make the effort to use the obvious pun here), and I am scared. Scared of bad acting, bad editing, poor plot. Two guys wake up in a shitty bathroom, tied to opposite corners by chains, nothing on them but their clothes and some tools they might need to survive, but haven't figured out how to use yet. In the beginning, I instantly thought of a CUBE-like setup, and was really looking forward to seeing it. But, as the story evolved more and more, I realised there was not much to it. A big chunk of this movie is told in flashbacks, to somehow ""justify"" why the two guys ended up there, how they are connected, and why the killer is acting the way he is (although, in the long run, I still can't quite explain why you have to kill people to show them how cool life is. Or why it makes you that insane and brilliant at the same time so that you have nothing better to do than set up strange traps that make people kill themselves, or why you start to enjoy watching your masterpiece of psychological torture-cabinet lying on the bathroom floor with your eyes closed, pretending to be dead. Ah, right, for the *surprise* ending. I forgot.) Everything is thought-out halfway, but that's where it ends. I mean, the story has potential, it could've made a really great movie, but they just ruined it to give them a platform to show off. ""Huh, yeah, see what I can do. I can use speed-up pictures and ultra-shaky camera. I bet you never saw this before, right?"" Right, right. Never. So, the standard tools to make a movie look young and fresh, again. What else do we need for a nice horror/slasher movie? Right, clich√©! Lots of it. And the main thing that really makes me mad is this ""Stupid Victim"" Syndrome. ""Hmmm. This guy just wanted to kill me, but now I have the gun...what should I do? Yeah, talk to my husband on the phone instead of shooting him (at least in the legs)."" Seriously, this scares the hell out of me. Can't ANYBODY please write a script that has ""normal-acting"" victims in it? Like, shooting the guy? Sorry, but this was a quite boring movie with bad acting and a poor script (though the idea was great). Yeah, poor. That sums it up quite well."
"They came, SAW and altered (Horror Movies)",24 February 2008,7.0,"I haven't seen the original short movie yet (titles SAW as well), but with this feature length effort, a change has been made in Horror movie history. A new sub-genre was born (some call it ""gorno"", because of the explicit gore it has in it)! Many movies tried to copy the formula, but didn't have financial success. Saw on the other hand, is a brand name now. A 5th saw movie will come out later this year (and more are yet to come).But let's talk about this original, that lays some seeds for the other movies to follow. We get the rules to which the character have to play (the general idea) or let's say the concept. It will keep you guessing from beginning to the end, what is going to happen. And although I like the other Saw movies as well, none of them achieved the tension that this one build up! Apart from the gore you'll get a thrilling experience as well! I can only recommend it (as many others do here too)"
Silly beyond belief (spoilers throughout),15 January 2006,7.0,"Saw is a film I was rooting for. It had the potential to be a grubby, nasty, eyesore of a film. But while it had gore and sadism in spades, it also had horrible acting, a terrible script and forgettable characters. Not even a man hacking off his own foot could make me overlook the tripe.Well, having said that, Cary Elwes hacking off his own foot did help somewhat, but the scene, rather than being traumatic, was a laugh riot. You have hysterical direction (you quickly cut from screaming man to screaming man ¬ñ close-ups of screaming men, especially when you quickly go from one to another, for some reason, always cracks me up), camp acting from Elwes (throughout the film he chews the scenery, but here he chews on his shirt) and cut around the scene is a hilarious car chase between Danny Glover and the red herring bloke. The cumulative effect is mucho laughter.The car chase, though, I think, of all of the funny things in the film, was the funniest. It was possibly the most low-rent thing I've seen in recent cinema. And although I acknowledge the fact that the filmmakers were working on a paltry budget, it still doesn't make it any less funny when you film grown-men pretending to drive stationary cars that are not so carefully given life by a bit of smoke and jittery camera-work and editing. Rear-projection would have looked a million times more convincing.Another budgetary giveaway was the car park that looked like it was filmed in a barn and which contained about five cars. I know you're meant to suspend your disbelief, and if the film were good I'd be able to do that, but when your film is ridiculous, it's just another nail in the coffin.But sniping aside, I do appreciate what the filmmakers have done with so little money. Although visually a rip-off of Seven, it does look good and most of the effects are pretty decent. However, I just wish they would have spent a bit more money on the script and cast someone (anyone) else in Elwes' role.Elwes is an actor who can get by just as long as he's not required to emote ¬ñ he can just about have a normal conversation. But once he's got to express anger or sadness or love, he's out of his depth. And so it is in Saw, sometimes with spectacular results.My favourite Elwes moment is when he recognises Zep (the red herring) in a photo and starts shouting like the man is alive inside it. Yes, if you shout loud enough the person in the photo WILL hear. (That's true.) But there's also the bit where the phone rings. He thinks it's Zep, so he shouts at the phone with camp venom. But it's his wife, so on a sixpence he changes into a doe-eyed husband, quivering with love and affection. Neither extreme is expressed in a believable way. But it doesn't help that Elwes has a weird thing he does with his voice. When he shouts he tries to boom like Brian Blessed, but when he expresses sadness or regret he talks in a child-like voice, almost like Joe Pasquale. It's a tad odd. And it makes his shooting of Adam bloody hysterical. ""You have to die. I'm sowwy. My family."" But Danny Glover is almost as bad. He goes metal when his partner gets killed by the fiendish Jigsaw Killer and tries to apprehend him on his own. But Danny Glover's portrayal of madness only extends to lots of incomprehensible shouting ¬ñ there's a brilliant bit where he runs out of bullets and charges the armed Zep while shouting ""Aaaaaaarrrggghhh!!"" But he does it again after the fight and as he runs out of the apartment to continue his pursuit. ""Aaaaarrrrrggggghhhhh!!"" And of course you then cut to the car chase and the foot cutting, which makes the film so overripe in tone that the only result can be hilarity.But that's kind of a shame, as the first half is pretty promising. I especially love the ingenious traps. My favourite is the razor wire. Suicidal man rips himself to shreds? Magnificent! And the scene where the woman had to stab the man and root through his guts had me cackling with delight. But I do have to admit that neither sequence disturbed me as it should. Indeed, they both made me laugh. And this is purely because of how they were filmed. Large parts were speeded up to capture the frenzied emotions of the characters, but it's a technique that always gives me the giggles. It's just so over the top and hysterical, that rather than unsettle me, it distances me from the grisly proceedings and makes me enjoy them in a way I'm sure the filmmakers didn't intend.And that goes for the whole film. I enjoyed it, but not in the intended way. I was laughing at the camp acting, jumping up and down with glee as men got torn to shreds in wire and rolling about when things went crazy at the end ¬ñ Adam has a lot of fire in his belly for someone who just got shot.And the villain also garnered laughs. He dressed like a goth (dig that robe and those gloves), moaned like a goth and hated the world like a goth. In fact, he probably was one. Wah-wah, I have cancer. Wah-wah, people don't appreciate their lives. Wah-wah, woe is me. I know most serial killers in films have BS reasons to justify their rampages, but this man made a fine art of it. And he sure was nimble for a cancer patient¬Öand could keep still for long periods of time¬Öand was remarkably indestructible. Ah, but why apply logic to a film this silly? Just open your arms and let the shower of crap wash over you."
Saw,25 August 2014,9.0,"The movie Saw is something that comes around every so often like the Blair Witch Project. A small budget film that gets tremendous buzz because it is done with such intelligent screen play and shock value. Saw is known for its incredible ending twist that no one saw coming and it blew all the audiences away. Aside from that the great characters, the acting and dialog is a little lackluster between the two leading men, Dr. Gordon and Adam. The writing, well thought out story and death trap scenes really put Saw over the top and being worthy of a great horror film. It was one of a kind until it came out and totally original that James Wan will be acknowledged for until the end of his directing days. Saw (9/10) is a creative, twisted low budget gem that is a can't miss."
Disappointing Sick Movie,14 November 2005,9.0,"Based on the comments of many acquaintances and friends of mine, I bought this DVD expecting an original and violent thriller. However, the tense beginning and the unexpected twist in the last scene are the great parts of this very sick movie, with a screenplay full of clich√©s and flaws. I was very irritated with many sequences along the story, such as, for example, when the killer was dominated by the detectives, and escaped from them. In a situation like that, the minimum they should do would be to shot one of the criminal's legs, shot the threatening drills and give attention to the victim. Later, when Alison Gordon fights with the killer, I believe any mother would immediately shot the bastard to protect her daughter and herself but Alison. Last but not the least, when Detective David Tapp chases the killer in the tunnels of the sewage plant, he prefers to fight with the sick guy instead of shooting him. The lack of credibility of these scenes really made me mad and upset with this movie. The comparison of ""Saw"" with ""Seven"" is simply ridiculous. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Jogos Mortais"" (""Mortal Games"")"
The twist in the end saved it,18 April 2007,7.0,"I had no idea of the story before I was going to watch it. I thought it was about a killer with a saw and killing teenagers just like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre but it turned out to be so different & unpredictable than any other horror movie it definitely took horror genre to a new level! The film is much more eerie & psychological than scary basically it plays with your mind mostly in the scenes were: 1. The guy Paul trapped in razor wire & was constantly cutting himself to get out.2. Where Amanda had the reverse bear trap in her mouth.3. When Dr. Gordon was sawing his foot that has to be the most horrifying scene. 4. When Adam was constantly pounding Zep with the toilet lid until it smashed.A couple of scenes were quite boring when Dr. Gordon was telling the story about him where he was in the car park and Adam's story when he was in his apartment just before his kidnapping. Their are a lot of mistakes in the film like: 1. They cannot saw off the chains but they can saw the pipe because it was really rusty & pipes are hollow it shouldn't take them longer than an hour.2. How did Jigsaw put an electrical currant through the pipes in a bathroom?3. If the 2 men were in a bathroom for more than 6 hours doing nothing than talking to each other & looking at the dead body they should of noticed him breathing.4. If you try to saw off your foot you faint of shock before it reaches the bone & you bleed to death straight away.5. Zep was doing all this because he was poisoned & wanted the antidote it's not a big deal just go to the hospital.Overall its a good film and I liked it because of its ending it has to be the best twist I ever seen in any film. When Adam killed Zep I was saying to my self ""It that it nothing great about it"" but when he pulled the tape recorder and played it my eyes expanded & I put the volume up a bit higher then the dead body raised and he turned out to be Jigsaw I almost fell off my seat. The corpse was there right in front of the audience the whole time & we never even suspected about it. Saw is amazingly shot in 18 days with a budget of $1.2 million & grossed almost about $103 million worldwide making it a huge hit."
instant classic,5 December 2011,7.0,"People asked me why didn't you review Saw when it came out. Simply, back then, seven years ago, you had to wait almost a year for the DVD release. When it came out part 2 was already at the cinemas. So I had to wait until they finished the franchise which was last year. But then again, it wasn't that simple to know what DVD or Blu Ray to pick up, because some were bloody versions or uncut or directors cut. All versions I have are the longest versions, I do have the German collector editions on Kinowelt, they are all uncut. It was my wife who came home one evening, she had won a screening, from the cinema and told me, I just have seen Saw, this is for you babe. And indeed, it became one of my 'things'. What did it for me is the storyline. There are so many twists that you just couldn't see coming. It was based on James Wan's short of 9 minutes called, sigh, Saw. He directed it, Leigh Whannell wrote it in 2003. With that short they went out to hunt a production team who wanted to make it a full feature. Nobody really believed in it but they were so wrong, the merchandise and the franchise it created was beyond limits. Leigh Whannell also played as David in the short and appeared as Adam in the full feature. What attracted me was that it was in fact just a simple police story with the focus on two victims of a serial killer. But what you couldn't see coming was that it contained a bit of real squeamish parts. The red stuff do flows and it is just on the border of gore. Due the fact that there were some really messy parts it created a new genre called Torture Porn, one year later Hostel was released and was gory as hell, with a bit of the same story, torturing for fun. The end of Saw is the strongest ending I have seen so far because what happens isn't predictable at all, and due that people start talking about Saw as they did about the reversed bear trap. The focus here wasn't really on Jigsaw, the serial killer. He was involved but wasn't the main concern of the coppers. But viewers were tricked by the writer of saw. The acting itself was really sublime especially by the victims Cary Elwes. It's also weird that most of the original actors didn't came back in the other parts, only in flashbacks. But naturally it's Jigsaw that steels the show, what Tobin Bell did was really creating a new hero for the horror geeks. This is his best role ever for me. Is it me or my imagination but I clearly saw some winks to the genre. When the so-called boogeyman appears in the closet just look how they filmed him, you just saw his eye in the closet, Black Christmas 1974 indeed. And at the end the closing of the metal door, Texas Chainsaw Massacre indeed. This is a must see for horror fans or people who liked a good police story like Seven or In Dreams. Gore 3/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 5/5 Comedy 0/5"
what happens if Zep never made it to the trapped Adam?,23 March 2005,10.0,"There were so many things wrong with this movie i have trouble keeping them all straight. But one thing that really bothers me is that if Jigsaw was the one laying on the ground in the bathroom, what happens if Zep never shows up? What if Zep was killed by Danny Gloover before he made it to the bathroom? Does Jigsaw simply just get up and walk out? Could the guy in the middle of the bathroom not be jigsaw, but another part of Jigsaw's game? What if Zep killed the wife and kid, how does Jigsaw get him the antidote for the poison if he's lying in the middle of the bathroom? Why does the doctor wait till the last minute to finally cut off his foot? It was too late, it was after six and as far as he knew his wife and child were already shot dead, it wasn't the best time for heroics. These are just a few questions i had about the film, but i may be missing something or everything as i have only seen the movie once. Please Help!"
This First Film In The Series & Best One Yet,12 September 2014,10.0,This film is the very first installment in saw franchise it is also the only best film out of them all once you saw it you cant deny it just don't let kids see this film its got a lot of blood in it.If you think the joker from DC comics is evil wait till you see this guy jigsaw he is the opposite of what he does the joker only cares about himself but jigsaw don't he don't care if he lives or dies all he cares about is the legacy & always looks for someone who can continue to be his prot√©g√© & successor.The Cast:i wont mention all of them it would take some serious space and IMDb wont allow it all of them did a good job but the lead guys and Tobin Bell oh god simply brilliant.The Plot:two guys wake up in a dirty room chained to the walls with no escape area available they wonder who kidnapped them but soon the clues are slowly revealed that they have fallen prey to the jigsaw a famous serial killer who never forgives and wants his victims to play his games.Now this is a horror film its got suspense and good dialog it is a bit slow as their are no gun fights here one scene in climax when the dead guy wakes up it is a shocker i wont reveal much here neither flaws all films got mistakes but this film does manage to entertain at big level all you have to do is enjoy it without reading critic reviews.Overall Saw 2004 is one of the best film from last decade my rating is 10/10:Recommended
"It ain't ""Last House..."" But comes really close!",30 October 2004,7.0,"In Wes Craven's film ""Last House on the Left"" two teenage girls are kidnapped, taken into woods nearby one of them's house, and tortured literally to death. Then the killers are met by sterner justice from the parents who lived in the last house on the left. This film included disembowelment, chest carving, stabbing, choking, shooting, fist thrown...the works. And to top it all off to boot, Craven had a social commentary to add to the already intense storyline.This film was a lot like ""Last House..."" with the exception of the moral at the end. this film was a plain, scare the pants off ya, turn the lights on in the middle of the night, scream out loud till ya barf twice go crazy, deadbolt your doors, pray you die early type of scare film. Two men are locked in a sewage room and must try to kill one another in order to be free. Other characters and lot twist are added along the way. But the film is executed unnervingly! Elwes and the other dude were really great in their roles. Danny Glover, as a dried out, discharged obsessed cop was great with what little time he had on screen. The rest of the cast did their own little private parts to make it pleasant. Intense character build up creates a surrealistic atmosphere that makes the audience concentrate on exactly what is going on.. creepy stuff.Audiences who see this will probably not be sleeping for awhile...Don't see it alone!"
Still the best one,26 May 2020,7.0,"It's easy to forget how good the first one is.The franchise has become synomynous with gore, but the first one has little to no on-screen blood or guts, at leats not in the same level as the sequels.Despite some cheesy acting and silly plot twists, it's still a really good psychological horror thriller."
An absolute masterpiece of a film,21 September 2023,7.0,"Saw is one of my absolute favourite films of all time. It is a psychological thriller/ horror with amazing plot twists. The writer Leigh Whannell even plays a character called Adam. The film was shot in a short amount of time with a limited budget but you really cannot tell. If you aren't sure whether you would like Saw or not,i would watch Saw 0.5 on YouTube first so that you can get a small idea. There is a whole franchise you can watch aswell. (although i do not recommend Jigsaw and Spiral the 8th and 9th films) Saw is a brilliant, well thought out film with an amazing plot, detail, set, costume, makeup and acting. I very highly recommend."
Sawed Through the Formulas!,29 April 2015,10.0,"Saw (2004): Dir: James Wan / Cast: Cary Elwes, Leigh Whannell, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Shawnee Smith: Two males awaken in a darken room each with an ankle chained to a pipe. They are equipped with a tape, which they must listen to in the tape recorder in the hand of the corpse laying in the centre of the room. Why are they there? The plot regards a psychopathic madman who kidnaps victims and teaches them the value of life through graphic games of torture. Cary Elwes plays a surgeon who neglects his family and is a suspect to a crime. Leigh Whannell plays a photographer linked to Elwes. Elwes is instructed to kill Whannell or his wife and daughter will die as a result. How this plays out will ultimately portray Elwes as one whose limits can surpass extreme pain, and Whannell left with darkened regret. Danny Glover plays a cop obsessed with solving the case after his partner was killed. This obsession leads to results and fatal consequences. Monica Potter plays Elwes's wife who uses brains to gain freedom and a mother's will to fight back. Shawnee Smith plays a victim who had escaped a trap thus spotlighted in hopes of getting into the psyche of the killer. Directed by James Wan with graphic violence yet clever writing. Title describes the pondering even with hacksaws at the disclosure of both victims. It regards how we often never appreciate life's blessings. Score: 8 / 10"
Surprisingly good for a low budget movie,25 October 2021,10.0,"The theme, the ending with one of the best plot twists ever, the games. Saw is a must watch movie for those who enjoy thriller and even horror movies."
Has One Of The Most Insane Endings But Ruined By Sloppy Plot-Holes,6 October 2023,7.0,"Pros:
1. The grainy cinematography gives the movie a gritty and grounded tone which helps to make the events feel realer.2. The murders, and the torture games, are incredibly grisly, disturbing as well as strangely introspective. The gore isn't the main focus unlike most horror films of this genre.3. The editing helps to imbue the torture and murder scenes with a chaotic and frenzied feel thus keeping you on edge.4. The score is remorseless in its intensity.5. Cary Elwes (Dr. Lawrence Gordon) and Leigh Whannell (Adam) carry the film which is impressive seeing as it's mostly just them conversing.6. The last 30 minutes have got to be some of the most heart-palpitating, insane and mind-blowing bit of cinema ever created. The ultimate pay-off, paired with the shock twist, is amazingly built up to and then executed.7. The movie offers an uncompromising, but truthful, view of human nature. Particularly how survival is hard-wired into all of us above anything else.Cons:
1. Why didn't Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover) and Detective Steven Sing (Ken Leung) remove Jigsaws' (Tobin Bell) hood? Instead they kept allowing him to move with his hood still up.2. How did Jigsaw survive both a bullet and a shotgun shell whilst just walking off with a limp?3. Somehow Jigsaw was able to remain completely stationary for over 6 hours."
This one belongs to the Razzies,27 February 2005,7.0,"(This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie, however it may change one's expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience.) Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. It was cut poorly and jumped around too much; making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction. The writers must not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been carried out, because the poor construction of time throughout the plot is discouraging to the viewer and makes the movie increasingly tiring to watch.Almost worse than the writers having abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller was the fact that it gradually relied on cheap tactics for a scare. The acting didn't make it scary, and the situations hardly made it scary, therefore it needed a few dark scenes with things jumping out at you to make it worthwhile. Even those were predictable.Not even the gore could've saved the plot, and it rivals the gore of the successful thriller Se7en.Speaking of Se7en, I feel like Saw tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed miserably in doing so. I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer. The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller; believe me, it is far from that.Oh, did I mention poor acting? At first, Cary Elwes seems makes a convincing performance; however, this completely deteriorates at the most crucial parts of the plot. I was left in tears of laughter at this performance, which is worthy of a Razzie. The performance of Leigh Whannell is also terrible and too played-out, although not as bad as the performance by Elwes, and the big red flag with this is that Whannell is also a writer for the movie.The end of Saw could never make up for having lost the entire middle of it, and that is what makes it a huge failure. It was an opportunity wasted, and I have no clue as to why Monica Potter and Danny Glover chose to take roles in this movie.I am mad at myself for wasting money on just renting it. It was definitely not worth the $4, and in the future I will definitely avoid seeing anything having to do with Elwes, Whannell or James Wan. The big tragedy in this is not that it lacked basis to its plot, it's that the great potential storyline was thrown away and poor acting added insult to injury. I'll avoid the poor puns involving the title and just conclude with this: don't watch this movie."
A cut above the rest.,29 October 2004,8.0,"SAW (2004) ***1/2 Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Leigh Whannell, Ken Leung, Dina Meyer, Michael Emerson, Shawnee Smith, Makenzie Vega, Tobin Bell. (Dir: James Wan) A cut above the rest.Finally a horror film that pays off in actually being scary! Novice filmmakers James Wan and Leigh Whannell ¬ñ director/ co-screenwriters ¬ñ have concocted a fiercely chilling tale of horror with echoes of dank √©lan to 'SE7EN' as well as any films during the seminal '70s the likes of Carpenter, Craven and Hooper in gleaning some of their mojo glommed onto their uniquely perverse, darkly humorous and more importantly downright bone-chilling spooky with this dark story of a fated morality play.The conceit begins with two strangers awakening from a drugged abduction to find themselves chained in a rotted industrial restroom (just the ghastly cinematography by David A. Armstrong and grotty production design by Julie Berghoff makes one crave a Tetanus shot!) and at the fate of a ticking clock coerced by the whimsy of a madman's sick, twisted game of life or death.Dr. Lawrence Gordon (a very fine turn by Elwes) is a successful oncologist and a slacker type named Adam (Whannell providing much needed gallows humor smart-aleckness) must unsolve a dastardly puzzle with big questions ¬ñ Who did this? Where are we? - to small details (each have a micro-cassette in their pockets and the only way to listen to the messages are provided in the hands of a blood drenched corpse littered at their feet clutching a tape recorder) as their time begins to erode ¬ñ as well as their sanity.Using flashbacks it is discovered by the good doctor that they are at their situation thanks to a serial killer ¬ñ or more apropos , serial gamesman ¬ñ tagged as 'Jigsaw' ¬ñ whose m.o. is to abduct someone and have them run thru an impossible mechanism designed solely to kill/maim them with the grand design being that each one realize just how precious a commodity life truly is.Adam and Gordon are also discovered to have a handy hacksaw provided for them to attempt an escape but soon learn that the tool will not cut through the heavy metal but should do so nicely through their own ankles! So begins the sweat-inducing, nerve-wracking quest of getting loose in time ¬ñ for Gordon particularly since he learns his wife and daughter (Potter and Vega) will be killed if he doesn't kill Adam (a single bullet has been left by the sicko and a handy revolver is in the other grasp of the bloodied victim on the filthy floor).Added to the mix is a police investigation involving Det. David Tapp (Glover, in a snaky 'I'm getting' too-old-for-this-s**t potshot at his 'LETHAL WEAPON' character) and his partner Det. Steven Sing (Leung) who are getting too close to the crazed genius with some truly lethal consequences.Wan milks several sequences in dark, cluttered and silent moments of dread while incorporating themes of infidelity, betrayal, redemption and employs a few stock gimmicks including grainy snuff-film video taping, a hair-raising sound effect of a maniacal clown laugh and just for the price of admission one of cinema's creepiest looking puppets to get his messages across.The screenplay by both ¬ñ native Australians ¬ñ hearkens back to slasher/psycho exploitation films yet raises the bar in their inventive, ingenious set pieces especially one ghastly recollection with a 'reverse bear trap' head device ; nuff said.There are moments of quiet devastation, nail-biting tension and just enough nervous laughter for the two protagonists racing against their inevitable doomed plight while also evoking many questions by the film's twisty canny climax (stop here if you don't want to realize the reason the pic is titled the way it is).Violence is underscored with scarily innate logic yet not over-the-top (I for one cannot wait for the DVD to see what made the editing floor to get its MPAA R ¬ñ rating) and it has some greatest hits of the genre standards like the rooting for the victims to get their much thirsted for vengeance.A true crowd-pleaser that doesn't disappoint but will have you wanting to return to put each simply creative puzzle piece together as more questions will come flooding by its stunning conclusion.You've been warned!"
Slick thriller in the mould of Se7en that covers writing weaknesses with consistent tension & urgency,10 October 2004,8.0,"(This review contains no spoilers but it is better when you know very little about it and I would suggest not reading any reviews on the film but to just go and see it!)Adam wakes up in a bath of water to find himself in a dark room, chained to a large pipe. On the other side of the room is one Dr Lawrence Gordon, who finds himself in the same position, in the middle of the room is a dead man with a gun and a Dictaphone in his hand. Two recorded messages reveal that Gordon's wife and daughter have been kidnapped and will be killed at 6pm that same day. The only way this will not happen is if Gordon kills Adam before this time, a feat that will involve getting out of his chains and to the gun.The marketing campaign for this film had a very impacting poster with very little text and just the word 'SAW' on it. In a way, with no real bankable names in the cast to sell itself on, the film sold itself on the one thing that will always get audiences in ¬ñ a concise and interesting central premise. Here it is very simple and very interesting and sets up a real tension from the outset that never really lets up until the very end. Let me just say now that tense is not the same as terrifying and viewers coming to this film looking for loads of gore and screaming horror will be let down; in fact I would class this film as a thriller more than I would a horror for this reason. The film opens with us right in this scenario of the chains etc and quickly we learn the ground rules and then learn more about the Jigsaw killer who is doing it. The flashbacks just take the edge off the main story a little bit but they do work well enough in themselves, and produce a more complex story.In a way this is where the weaknesses come in because the hook of the simple premise is expanded out into a wider story ¬ñ and not all of it hangs together with a great deal of logic. The motives of the killer are unsure and the way that everything does fit into place is unconvincing (to name two problems) but, while it is on, the film's tension covers these gaps and does a good job of holding you in its spell. This spell lasts no longer than the final credits as you begin to pick holes in the actual story, but by then you'll have been entertained and into the film too much to really let the plot holes bother you and it is only those hoping for a story to match the darkness of Se7en will be letdown, this is not of the same caliber as that film but it is still fun. The director has learnt from several other films and genres. He knows that the simple premise can be used as a great hook for a simple story (many short films do the same), he knows from Se7en that sometimes the horror we imagine is much worse than the one we can see, and he knows from recent Japanese horror movies that unsettling images are scarier than outright gore (hence the use of clown and pig heads). In terms of style the film is winning if a little overdone. Time skips forward with frantic camera movements, 'dank' is painted thick on every scene and generally the film delivers a mood of tension, urgency and unsettling action.Not using the cast for the marketing was a good choice because there are no real a-list names here and, sadly, there are several botched jobs on the acting side. Whannell is good and does a solid job ¬ñ even handling the script's 'comic relief' requirements without letting it take away from the dire nature of his situation. Elwes is OK but not as consistent. At times his delivery is flat and sounds like he is delivering some more serious lines in his 'Princess Bride' character, sounding insincere and wooden. It also didn't help that his make up for the majority of the film made him look like a tired old queen ¬ñ I know it was supposed to be like white plastery stuff, but on Whannell it looked good but on Elwes it looked like it had been spread evenly! Glover is OK but given too little to do and his character changes too much too quickly before we have even known who he was.Support from people like Leung and Martinez add familiar faces and generally the support cast do OK ¬ñ but in keeping with the simple premise idea, the film is best when it keeps those involved to the minimum.Overall this is an effective thriller. It will be compared to Se7en but it doesn't have the writing to really stand in the same crowd as that movie; the plot has too many holes and the twists often come from a desire to surprise and confound rather than coming as a natural part of the story (ie they don't have the common sense impact of Se7en's conclusion). However what it does do well is deliver a sense of tension and urgency focused on this 'simple' premise. This tension works so well that it pretty much covers the plot problems while you are watching the film, and you are swept along with it as you watch. After the film you'll pick away at it and it won't stand up to repeat viewings but it is still a great fun film while you're with it."
One of the best films of the year,18 February 2005,7.0,"Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Larry (Cary Elwes) awaken to find themselves locked in a filthy, dilapidated public bathroom. As they regain awareness, things go from bad to worse. They see a dead body on the floor between them, and then they realize that they're chained to large pipes on opposite sides of the room. When they discover a hidden message for each, they learn that a madman is playing a sick game with them. Can they win the game and escape with their lives? Every once in a while, I'm given an opportune moment to engage in a mini-rant, so here we go. Anyone wondering why I usually pay no attention to the Academy Awards need look no further than Saw. In my view, Saw should be nominated for eight 2005 Oscars: Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Elwes), Best Achievement in Directing, Best Writing--Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, Best Achievement in Cinematography, Best Achievement in Art Direction, Best Achievement in Makeup, and Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures--Original Song (Fear Factory's ""Bite the Hand That Bleeds""). Not that I feel it should necessarily win all eight, but it should have a fair shake at them. There are others that I would nominate for some of those categories--including Hellboy, The Village, AVP: Alien vs. Predator, Dawn of the Dead, Kill Bill Vol. 2, Shaun of the Dead, and Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. But you'll note that out of those, only The Village got a nod (a single nomination). It's difficult for me to take something seriously that is so far off the mark when it comes to recognizing quality films. But it's not as if a general anti-genre bias in the Academy Awards--as well as with professional critics and the self-appointed film literati--has not been noted before.James Wan and Whannell (who takes on double duty as an actor) have authored a tightly interwoven story, with a puzzle theme that draws you in like the best material of the Cube (1997) series combined with a gritty, Se7en (1995)-like serial killer police procedural. The pieces of the plot fit together precisely and unfold like a predetermined chess game. Wan and Whannell build tension gradually, despite the fact that the film comes out of the gate extremely suspenseful.Wan, who also served as director, creates a fabulously disturbing, dingy atmosphere throughout the film, bolstered by Julie Berghoff's production design, which is as inventive as the script. Part of the delightful novelty of the film is the elaborate, potentially fatal puzzles devised by the villain. Berghoff's designs for these scenarios and devices easily matches the lockstep intricacy of the plot and the ominous foreboding of the overall atmosphere. Viewers will likely cringe at vicariously envisioning themselves in the contraptions, and that's much of the point. The cinematography throughout the film is just as imaginative, easily telling a story that often depends on subtle visual cues, and reaching just the right balance of extended techniques, such as the varied film speeds during a car chase.Because so much of the film is focused on just two characters in a single, relatively sparse room, Elwes and Whannell must turn in powerhouse performances, running a gamut of emotions including vulnerable helplessness, studied hopefulness, vengeful anger and frenzied desperation. Both are excellent, with Elwes particularly remarkable. Danny Glover, as Detective David Trapp, is impressive in his transformation from a somewhat typical macho cop to an obsessive loon, perhaps on a par with the villain in his single-minded irrational commitment.The modus operandi and motivation (which serves as the theme) of the villain are intriguingly gray. The victims are often morally questionable, and can potentially benefit from their victimization. They're putatively given an out from their predicaments if they can muster the necessary wit and skill. At least on one level, the villain wants to give his victims a hard lesson and improve their lives.It should have been clear by the comparison to Cube and Se7en that Saw is not for the faint of heart (although it's not quite as gory as it could have been) or for those who want only clear messages of good and evil and happy endings. As one of 2004's best films, however, you owe it to yourself to give it a watch."
So I saw Saw and....,21 February 2005,7.0,"I must say the fuss about all the bad acting was unwarranted. I thought all the players did what they could with what they had. The trouble is movie nerds are almost afraid to disagree with one another these days. My biggest gripe against this movie is the ole' too much plot getting' in the way of the story syndrome. This would of hit so much harder if it were slimmed down to about 80 minutes and somehow excised the character of Zep the orderly and told with more continuity. Good lord this thing was flashing back left and right and sideways too I think. The tension was all in that room with Elwes and the worst actor of the film Whannel. Aside from the creepy car crawl scene, you could just feel the tension alleviate as soon as they took the movie out of that dank hell hole. At any rate I wasn't as disappointed in the acting as I was the way the story was told. Ah well an excellent horror film is coming someday, maybe in James Wans' next effort?"
"Yeah, I saw it. That is to say I seen it.",3 October 2013,8.0,"Saw really should be exempt from most criticism as James Wan managed to pull of a helluva trick considering the innumerable restrictions and compromises that made the shoot very hard for the first-time feature director. Who'd ever believe that such a tiny movie would be the first to re-invent horror for the 21st century? Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell play Doctor Gordon and hapless jerk Adam, a mis-matched duo who wake up in a disgusting bathroom chained to the piping at either end of the expansive room. A dead body lies between, blood and gore on the floor around it. Doctor Gordon suspects that it is the work of the infamous ""Jigsaw"" - a madman known for subjecting lowlifes to brutal tests to prove their desire to live.A series of flashbacks follow which build a greater story around the plight of the two men, culminating in a climax that is still as unnerving now as it was nearly 10 years ago. Saw is a very clever film, but is let down by overly filtered cinematography, choppy editing that is full of stutter cuts, and a sound design that is bloated with far too many cheap stingers. The acting is a little weak at times too but considering the conditions, and the fact that there was no rehearsal at all so the footage you see is sometimes the first attempt by the actors to get it done means you can't judge it too harshly.The production design tries to emulate David Fincher's Se7en but ends up looking like a cheap 70s porno. But the whole film was shot in one big building, so you just can't pick faults. Like I said, what Wan managed to pull off with the time and budget he was given is nothing short of remarkable. The sequels were given more money to crazy with, but the first Saw movie should be viewed as a different entity.Love it or hate it, Saw is a major achievement for the fledgling writer/director pairing of Whannell and Wan."
One word Brilliant,12 January 2005,8.0,"I'm really disappointed that this movie didn't do as well as it should have at the box office, it deserved better because this film is brilliant.The plot is original, the acting is pretty good (for being shot in 18 days with a low budget), the direction is perfect. This is the type of film that builds tension, not your typical shocker or hack and slash (which is what I thought it was going to be, boy was I wrong) it's psychological horror. I don't know how the director came up with the idea of the scene were the guy has to use the camera to see in the dark, perfect bit of audience manipulation, he makes you feel like you're blind in the dark like the character; ingenious not to mention creepy. I can only say that you should see this film it's brilliant. Oh yeah and the ending will blow you away."
A non realistic movie,5 December 2005,7.0,"This was the most unrealistic movie I ever seen.I can't believe that the writer and director didn't see that almost all the movie looks like a SF one.For example: 1. It is impossible for the killer to stay on cold glaze and after 10 hours to get up so quickly.2. You can't get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the movie.(believe me, it's my domain)3. With a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hour very easy. Let's say that the chain was made from steel but the water pipe was rusty and it was made from iron.4. If you try to cut your foot with a saw you faint (in the best case, it's more likely to die because your hart fails) before to get to the bone(shin).And there are more other examples."
Silence of the Lambs + Mythbusters = Win,11 October 2015,7.0,"Horror films like this may be old hat today, but I think we should dedicate a moment of silence to honor what may have been the first of its kind. OK, enough silence, let's get back to blood curdling screams.""Saw"" distinguished itself from the usual 90s-00s horror tosh by taking a pseudo intellectual approach as in classics like ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""The Cell"" where the killer is not just a mindless hockey goalie on a bad day with power tools. The killer has a distinct, logical, stylish modus operandi that will appeal to people who know the meaning of the word ""modus operandi"". If you don't, or if you don't care, there's still plenty of suspense, action and blood & guts (literally) to keep you entertained from start to finish.""Saw"" is the story of a serial killer who is highly intelligent, highly resourceful (some of the diabolical devices he builds could be featured on Mythbusters), and most interestingly the killer is driven by a twisted sense of morality. This brings to mind the mother of all serial-killer-morality tales ""Seven"" which Saw undoubtedly drew inspiration from. While I don't think ""Saw"" is in league with ""Seven"", it does a great job of keeping up, and I think it's worth a watch.Danny Glover (""Lethal Weapon"") playing the obsessed cop on a manhunt and Cary Elwes (I'll always remember him from ""The Princess Bride"") playing the intelligent victim, raise the bar with their excellent, characteristic performances. And while the story may have 1 or 2 loopholes, you can handily overlook them in light of these two iconic actors and a story that unravels suspensefully at every turn.I did want to mention one thing for the squeamish (as well as those of you who crave the squeam), ""Saw"" isn't as over-the-top disgusting as I had been told. Yes, there's a ton of blood and a few hurl worthy scenes of bad things happening to body parts, but for the most part it's somewhat tame by today's standards. I actually like that, because it's a film I can recommend to my mom. The lack of nudity/sex and the interesting morality angle furthermore might make it a family-safe film. If your family happens to live at 1313 Mockingbird Lane. But you catch my drift."
"2 guys waking up in a cold atmospheric room not knowing why, and how they got there. just bound to a chain and waiting till the game begins",4 March 2005,1.0,"this movie mixes several attributes which made me giving a 10-rating: the beginning is fascinating with a cube-like atmosphere. it never loses suspense thru the whole movie....and the sick mind of the killer reminds to john doe's from ""se7en"" of brilliant David Finch. the turnings of the storyline are almost unpredictable which is rare and never any Hollywood-like clich√© or happy-end. a lot of surprises, shock and some gore scenes which altogether makes it a perfect horror-psycho-thriller.in my opinion, it beats even cult horror-movies like Texas chainsaw massacre 2003, event horizon, dawn of the dead 2004, cube, wrong turn or evil dead. thru out the time, these kind of movies goes far to the limits of the violence and dark fears we all got into us....so be warned, ""saw"" will give you a sightseeing tour thru hell....enjoy it !"
Creepy thriller which has you second-guessing everything,26 February 2005,1.0,"Saw's trailers and teasers are full of misleading clips which make you believe that the story is about a maniacal killer who has a grouping of puzzles that the person captive must solve in order to stay alive. What the trailers do not tell you is the depth of emotion and psychosis that was put into the movie itself that has you actually caring about those possible victims.This film was a hair-raising thriller to the worst degree as you see characters trying to figure out how they are going to get out of a dire struggle for life and more time to figure out their future after the day that they get put into such a situation. The shots were very stylish and moody as anything released before this film. There has never been a horror/thriller quite like this before, which is amazing because so many thrillers released within the last 5 years have either copied each other in certain shots or stylistics, or they steal from the problems of the main villain of other films. This does neither and it's amazing.The music was on par with movies like 8mm and Se7en and that sort of heavy metal meets unknowing timpani sets of action movies' past. The film was very stylistic, but given the time that it was shot in (18 days!), the film seems better directed knowing that they took less time to do it in. The film was written and directed by the same man (with help from another guy writing), and hopefully we'll see more from the director. The whole puppet thing was odd, and it didn't need to be in this film for anything else than a visual creepy thing, and later on, it served a purpose to tell detectives where the murderer was, but still... I was kind of angry about the fact that there was no in-depth behind-the-scenes on the DVD, and instead it was replaced by an extra-long ""making-of"" of a horrible Fear Factory video. (the video is basically the movie, but more green-screens and cheesy effects including a fake heart, a model who couldn't act, and a lead singer who couldn't have cared less about him being in the video) So I gave this film 7/10 stars. I also would've casted a different doctor actor (from the beginning, he seems to be overacting a lot of the time). But Danny Glover was amazing and a class-act amongst a lot of no-name actors in the States (I might've seen the doctor actor before, but he looks like every other straight-character-actor). But those points are the only I could find wrong with this film. It is a definite buy if you have a chance because of everything I said up above."
Saw isn't too sharp,21 May 2005,10.0,"Two people wake up chained to pipes on opposite ends of a room, the two must figure out how to get out. This film started off pretty well and stayed that way all the way to the first flashback where it all begin to unravel. I sat there dumbfounded as the movie got worse and worse. Seeing plot holes left and right. The acting ranged from bad to outright crap. The film is less like the roller-coaster ride it was billed as and more like a stupefying free-fall in quality. Everyone says ""oh the twist is cool"" NOPE, I saw it coming (no pun intended) within five minutes of the start. Deemed one of the best horrors of the year? PLEASE, if that's true I openly weep for the genre, as I had stool samples that were more horrifying by far.My Grade: D+"
One of my fave 5!,18 October 2020,10.0,I wish I could watch it for the first time again. So creepy and surprising.
"Great horror, but is ultimately lacking in purpose",3 March 2005,10.0,"Considering it is by some margin the best contribution to American horror since Se7en, Saw is a strangely unengaging film.It is certainly slick enough. Throwing you right into the action you awake, along with the lead character (Adam) in a Fincher-esque, dingy underground bathroom/dungeon. You soon find Adam is not alone. Across the room another is another man. Both are chained by the ankle, taken by the mysterious jigsaw killer. The room contains a dead body, a gun and two saws. To survive, one of the men must kill the other by 6pm. If not, both die. Problem is, the saws won't cut the chains. To make it out, you must not only be prepared to kill; you also have to saw off your own foot¬ÖNice.Don't get me wrong, there are some good, if not terribly subtle, twists in the film; told mainly through the flashbacks of Adam's fellow captive, Lawrence. And the film has one or two moments that will be relished by the gore-fest lovers. There is some pretty good acting here too, especially from Leigh Whannell (Adam) and Danny Glover (Detective Tapp).The problem mainly lies in the fact that the film is such an obvious homage to Se7en - many of stylistic devices very reminiscent of the Fincher film ¬ñ without any of the substance. Fincher manages the neat trick of wallowing in the murky side of the human psyche while appearing appalled by it as well. Saw just seems to revel in the brutality. If you're expecting moments that force the audience to be introspective, you won't find them here. Saw just isn't interested in discussing apathy, or greed or even the value of life that the killer talks about. The jigsaw killer is just another sick f*ck, complete with Thomas Harris name, eerie doll, dank warehouse apartment and kitsch slasher movie hang-outs (like subterranean car parks).All this leaves the film feeling a bit devoid of purpose. In style very much life Se7en, in execution, more like Friday 13th. Which is a shame, because there really is much to enjoy here if you're a fan of the red stuff. 6/10"
trying to unsee what i Saw (haw haw),18 April 2005,6.0,"There are some actors who are terrific no matter who's directing them. (Paul Bettany, Denzel Washington) There are others who are irredeemably awful in absolutely anything (Ryan O'Neal comes to mind). And then there are guys like Cary Elwes. He was dynamite in The Princess Bride, every bit as swashbuckling and fun to watch as Errol Flynn. He shines in ensemble pieces; equally convincing as the desperately manipulative Thomas H. Ince in Peter Bogdanovich's pathetically under-seen The Cat's Meow and as a fat, balding, prissy theater producer in Cradle Will Rock. Of course, it helps that all these are good movies, which the generic horror flick Saw is not.Not that it doesn't try. It's got that grinding, industrial-metal soundtrack, to get us all edgy when the film itself cannot. It's got those hyper-motion quickcuts, the same kind used in the remake of Thirteen Ghosts, which at least knew how lame it was, and was thus easier to take, with tongue firmly in cheek. Perhaps using the gore factor (which there isn't much of; Shaun of the Dead was gorier than this) to patch up some gaping, 747-size holes in the plot, Saw cheerfully telegraphs the shock moments, using some halfway-clever plot twists that almost make sense at the time but on second thought¬ówhat a mess.Anyway, here's the set-up: A kid named Adam (Leigh Whannell, who wrote the script) wakes up in a nasty old bathroom chained to a huge pipe in the wall. Opposite him is Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes), similarly chained and even more confused. Between them lay a dead man, his head apparently half-blown away, holding a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. It's all revealed to be the work of the ""Jigsaw Killer,"" who devises unique life-or-death scenarios for unsuspecting, flawed folk to work their way out of or die. (Set this in a giant, three-dimensional Rubik's Cube, and you have the much more intriguing Cube; set it in another unnamed city with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman hunting a deranged Bible-nut, you get Se7en¬óWhannell has obviously seen and studied them both).So Adam and Dr. Gordon are trapped together, for reasons that are calmly explained away in a series of flashbacks. The goal: Gordon must kill Adam with whatever implements are at hand or else his wife and daughter will buy the farm. And yes, in a toilet stall they find a couple of hacksaws.Nothing is what it seems, of course, and I have to report that I saw the final denouement coming from the first twenty minutes. The enigmatic ""Jigsaw Killer"" is a lot like the alien race out to destroy humanity in Independence Day: faceless and just plain bad, bad, bad! Kevin Spacey's genuinely chilling John Doe from Se7en may have been a fairly one-note character, but at least we were given reasons for his psychosis¬óand what's more, we believed them. Saw's killer is given a perfunctory motivation, but it all rings as off-key as the acting.First-time director James Wan wastes Danny Glover as a cop obsessed with the case, and his demise is a complete let-down. He delivers some nice, gruesome moments, but since I saw (pun not really intended) them coming, they're not much more than Pavlovian audience buzzers. Judging by the general crowd reaction, Saw will get plenty of word of mouth help from the high school set, make a nice, tidy little profit, and since a sequel has already been announced, old Jigsaw will likely be around torturing people for no apparent reason for some time."
The piecing together of a brutal puzzle ensues.,29 October 2004,6.0,"How far would you go to save your own life? Go ahead; ask yourself that question right now. Exactly how far would you go? Would you kill someone if your life were on the line? Would you cut through someone's stomach to get something you needed to save yourself? Would you watch an entire night of UPN programming with no interruptions? Would you make out with Rosie O'Donnell? The extent a person would go to save his life, an indication of how much he actually wants to live, is the underlying theme of Saw.The movie follows the sick and twisted exploits of a killer only known as ""Jigsaw."" But in reality, he hasn't killed anybody. He's much more sadistic than that. He places people in very dire circumstances and then tells them what they need to do in order to survive. It's all part of his game. You break the rules, then you'll pay the consequences.Simply put, Saw is one of the most entertaining, original thrillers of the year. You might want to introduce yourself to the edge of your seat before the movie starts because chances are the two of you will be getting acquainted real quick. In fact, it might not hurt to bring it flowers. My interest was piqued at the very start, and just when I was scared I had figured everything out (and was getting disappointed because I thought things were going to be too predictable), the movie slapped me right upside my face and taught me a little lesson in not thinking too far ahead.Now if you're the nitpickiest of nitpickers, then you can find enough nits to pick if you have nothing better to do. The movie's got its flaws; I won't deny that. Plot contrivances? Check. Plot holes? Sure. The acting? Well, it's a tad suspect at times, mainly in regard to Cary Elwes. Rumor has it that a landing strip was placed on ""the top,"" and he just flew right over it. Elwes kicked subtlety in the crotch, and then beat it while it was down. He's all right when he is more constrained, but at times it feels like he is auditioning for a high school production of Hamlet. I haven't seen so many crocodile tears since Bill Clinton attended Ron Brown's funeral. Oh well, just be prepared to laugh at him and you'll be fine. Other than that, the acting is decent even though most of the characters like to scream a lot.Personally, I can ignore the film's flaws because I was mainly concerned with where the movie was headed and if it could pull everything together effectively. I'm happy to report that the climax is possibly the most exciting, most intense 10-15 minutes of any movie I've seen this year. Off the top of my head I count six unexpected twists in that short amount of time. To put it bluntly, the ending knocked my socks off, ran 'em through the rinse cycle, chewed 'em up into little pieces, spit 'em in my face, and made me thank it for the privilege. It was quite the spectacle.I guess I better warn you that if you're looking for a pot of gold and a rainbow at the end of these proceedings, then you'll be disappointed. But I liked the ending. It fit with the dark tone and dreary atmosphere of the rest of the movie. This isn't a love-fest about every child in the world getting a puppy. It's a movie about a demented individual with a really warped view on what constitutes a fun game. I guess Yahtzee just doesn't do it for some people.THE GISTSaw is the perfect thriller to get you in the Halloween spirit. It's not what I'd call overly scary, but it'll keep you in a constant state of unease. The scariest thing about the movie is that there *could* be an individual out there like ""Jigsaw,"" but it's probably best if you don't dwell on that.If you don't like gruesome movies that revolve around people in very tense, unenviable positions, then this may not be for you, but it wasn't nearly as gory as I was expecting. For the most part we're shown the beginning of an act of violence or gore, and then we're allowed to form our own mental images. It's really nothing I haven't seen on a very special ""Viewer Discretion is Advised"" episode of CSI. So if you think you can handle it then check it out and enjoy the thrill ride. Rating: 4 (out of 5)"
What a Masterpiece!,31 August 2021,7.0,Two aussie's from a young age wanted to make a film with a low budget and only a room. Just think about it . James Wan and Leigh W. Makes themselves heard in the industry. With a gripping storyline and the twist in the end what really makes this movie a all time classic. No one can ever say they 'SAW' it coming! And the background score too. All in all go ahead watch it.
Saw is an uneven but satisfying film. (possible spoiler),6 November 2004,7.0,"Oftentimes you watch a movie and can easily tell that it was inspired by current events. Obviously Saw wasn't ripped from the headlines of yesterday's paper, but I think a recent, amazing story of survival may have sparked the filmmakers' imaginations. The event I'm referring to is when Aron Ralston cut off his own arm with a pocket knife after being trapped under a rock for 5 days. There are no trapped mountaineers in this film, but a couple of guys are chained to a wall with nothing but a hacksaw that isn't sturdy enough to cut the chain. Hmmmm¬Ö. How are they supposed to escape?Saw tells the story of two men who awaken to find themselves chained to opposite sides of a nasty bathroom with a dead man face down in blood between them. The dead man is holding a gun and a cassette player; each of the two men wake with a tape that gives them clues on how to survive the day. One of the men, a doctor, is given a few hours to somehow kill the other man or his wife and child will be murdered. The person responsible is a twisted serial killer who rather than killing his prey, sets up elaborate traps where the victims either kill themselves or someone else. I don't want to give away too much because I want you to be as intrigued as I was while watching. It's not often that a thriller works so well for so long, but I was completely enthralled by the story and the setup. There are only a couple things that keep this movie from hitting the bullseye: acting, and uh, overacting.Sure this is a low budget movie, and it isn't packed full of familiar faces. The problem is that the guys we don't recognize do a fine job, while a couple of 'old faithfuls' are all over the map. Not only is Cary Elwes all over the map, he's all over the desk next to the map; he's across the street in the map shop looking for a map large enough to contain his awkward performance. Elwes plays one of the two men trapped in the bathroom. He's a doctor who recognizes what is happening because he was once a suspect in the search for the vile, but creative, serial killer. The good news is that he doesn't come across as a total and complete hack. He's believable for the first half of the movie, but whenever he has to show any sort of emotion, he crumbles. Acting classes should be forced to watch his performance to see the perils of overacting. He looks more like an actor trying to portray anger, than a man whose unusual circumstances have driven him into a panic. It's a terrible tragedy when the audience is laughing through the climax of a film because the actor can't carry the part. His performance is so over the top ¬ñ so completely distracting ¬ñ that the film really suffers.The usually steady Danny Glover is also inconsistent. He plays the lead detective investigating the serial killer, nicknamed 'Jigsaw.' His character is very emotionally driven but not enough time is given to his development. The audience can't help but question his motivation and many times the logic behind some of his decisions. The part was never fleshed out and because of this, Glover's performance is weak. He just didn't have enough to work with.The supporting actors fare much better. Monica Potter is good as the doctor's wife, and Makenzie Vega is quite good as her daughter. The most pleasant surprise was the performance of Leigh Whannell, also one of the screenwriters. Whannell plays the other man who finds himself chained to the wall in the bathroom. There were a few weak moments, but overall his performance was solid.A lot of hype has been given to how shocking, disturbing, and scary this film is. Let me set the record straight. Saw isn't scary, but it is suspenseful. It's much more of a thriller than a horror movie. There are a few surprises, and a few truly disturbing sequences, but as hard as it tries, Saw doesn't achieve the atmosphere and feel of Se7en. That's not to say that it doesn't successfully create a disturbing mood. A couple moments really worked for me. There is a creepy moment with the young daughter of the doctor (Makenzie Vega) staring at a mobile in her room, wondering if the boogie man is there. Another sequence with a man using a camera as a flashlight also worked well. In fact, the first three quarters of the movie successfully draw the audience into the story and the characters. But then it starts to fall apart.The final act of Saw feels like a different movie. The tone seemingly changes, and the film relies on clich√©s and coincidences to drive the story. It becomes a cookie cutter thriller straight from the Ashley Judd school of predictability. But then everything changes again. SPOILER WARNING: DON'T CONTINUE READING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OK, the ending is great. The movie had hit rock bottom and there were no explanations for the actions of the characters. Then there is a twist and everything makes sense. As great as the twist may be, I'm not sure it makes up for the previous 15 minutes of the film. It's hard to forgive what the movie does to the audience during that sequence. I felt detached from the film and I felt the story had let me down. Still, I don't often fall for surprise endings, and this one got me good."
convoluted bloody fun,28 November 2015,1.0,"Adam Stanheight wakes up in a dirty lavatory chained to a pipe. He finds Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) also chained on the other side of the room. There's a dead body in the middle. They play audio tapes and the voice tells Gordon that he must kill Stanheight before 6 O'clock or else his wife Alison (Monica Potter) and daughter Diana (Makenzie Vega) will die. Adam finds two saws in the toilet tank. Gordon suspects the perpetrator is the Jigsaw Killer. He recounts police detectives David Tapp (Danny Glover), Allison Kerry (Dina Meyer) and Steven Sing (Ken Leung) investigating. Zep Hindle (Michael Emerson) is an orderly and John Kramer (Tobin Bell) is his patient. Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith) is the only known survivor of the killer's elaborate games with a harness wired to her jaw.I love the compelling premise of two guys chained in a room. Once Amanda Young's harness shows up, the movie becomes too convoluted to be scary. On the other hand, it becomes fun splatter. There is no denying that the elaborate plans are ridiculous but the movie completely owns it. Jigsaw is a Picasso clown and that's part of the fun. There is an interesting mystery of trying to escape from the room. It would be better if Jigsaw isn't so invasive leaving the clues. For example, there is no need for a clue to tell them to turn off the lights. It would be more compelling for the guys to guess on their own. It feels like a carefully laid out path and there is no tension in that. I'm not revealing the final twist but there are good points and bad points about that. It's impossibly elaborate but utterly surprising."
Best game of them all,27 August 2021,1.0,"Recently watched the beautiful 4K restoration (a must) and only got better than I even remembered. A twisted, clever and suspenseful movie with great characters and a classic shocker ending that won¬¥t be overlooked nor overtaken."
Clever. Heart pounding fright and terror. The birth of a new horror franchise.,31 October 2006,8.0,"Saw when first released in 2004, the low budget horror flick, wasn't expected to do much, but guess what surprise over 100 million! It looks as if though James Wan has founded a new horror gem. When I finally viewed it I was amazed at the clever plot and bloody gore. Saw is well done, well shot as it tries to teach us morals. Only these life lessons are taught by a new sadistic serial killer Jigsaw, who abducts his morally wayward and he puts each in a horrific game of cat and mouse survival. The abducted must fight for life or die in the process. And some of Jigsaw's methods are clever and cruel such as chaining victims feet together, strapping people to seats with leather even ranging from fire torture and barb wire cutting methods how cruel and sick! Saw begins with Carry Elwes who plays an abducted doctor who is chained up with an abducted photographer, the cat and mouse game is clever and sickening, as Jigsaw watches both thru camera and makes cell phone calls to them! The Elwes character is unaware that Jigsaw has held hostage his wife and daughter, and the only way they survive is that the photo man must die. Monica Potter and Makenzie Vega give fine performances as the wife and daughter of the Elwes's character. It is just so sad and sickening though when the sadistic killer has both the Monica and Makenzie characters bound, tied up and gagged. As while both are pleading for mercy the crazy uses a stethoscope to check the fright and fast heartbeat of Makenzie while he points a gun to Monica's head, how terrifying as they both scream and cry thru their gagged mouths. Really a tough scene, overall this film is frightening in a way that disturbs the mind as a dangerous game that's tough to win, it seems only the lucky survive. Saw is a must see it was good to finally see a new twist and take on the horror genre with Jigsaw. I must finally say a thumbs up for James Wan's clever new fright franchise."
Saw cuts through a meticulously intricate crime mystery with nothing but bloody wits.,28 May 2019,8.0,"The cultural phenomenon that has spawned an entire, albeit probably unnecessary, franchise including sequels, prequels, video games and a theme park ride (Thorpe Park anyone?). The film that put the modern legend that is James Wan on the blood-soaked Hollywood map, whilst also establishing the Wan/Whannell dream team. So, this being my first time watching it, was Saw really that sharp of a thriller? Or just blunted by its overbearing sequels? Well, suffice to say, it holds up with excellence. Two men wake up in a dilapidated bathroom with only one order: one must kill the other in order to save his family.An ultimatum that would test the psychological stimuli and moral compasses of both the characters and the audience. Raising that inevitable question: ""what would you do?"". Wan immediately inserts his hyper-kinetic energy, with the assistance of the hyperactive editing team, and introduces several of his trademark directing techniques. Panoramic camera rotations, seamless switches between handheld and static and elongated takes through dark corridors. Sometimes the bursts of 30-40 cuts within a 3 second timeframe is somewhat disorientating, and the aura of TV-movie presides over the frenetic editing, however Wan just about maintains a level of cinematic quality. And with that, his unique storytelling along with Whannell'a script makes for a tantalising thriller.The suspense immediately kicks in when we find ourselves stuck in this room with these two unknown characters. Why are they here? Who are they? How do they escape? It resembled one of those ""escape room"" activities that seem to be rapidly popular for recreational enjoyment these days. But then the narrative shifts. Of course Wan could not keep up the tension for an hour and forty minutes in a room, there wasn't enough substance. So he ingeniously integrated a flashback structure that slowly revealed who these characters were and why they were there tied up in chains. It had a sniff of 'Se7en' meets 'CSI: Miami'. Yet it illustrated the almost labyrinthine story that Whannell devised, with Wan carefully placing breadcrumbs. It held my attention solidly throughout. The serial killer ""jigsaw"", along with his puppet, was practically immortalised after this film. Horror fans would consistently quote ""I wanna play a game"", which is a testament to the staying power of Wan's creation.There are however a few issues. The acting on occasion was, how can I put it, iffy. Whannell starred in the film alongside Elwes and were probably the strongest performances. Glover, Smith and Vega on the other hand were not nearly as effective. The devices and traps that ""Jigsaw"" created unfortunately didn't hold much memorability. Mostly because they were tainted by frantic editing, particularly the barbed wire trap, but mostly because the focus was solely on the current mystery. Which is acceptable, although the sudden focus on the ""jaw breaker"" device held no tension and lost the suspense raised so far, merely included just to highlight the crazed morality of the antagonist.Oh, how could I end this review without spoiling the infamous plot twist? I jest. Unfortunately I knew about it beforehand, but its execution was effortless and I would imagine it blew everyone's mind upon release. That accompanied with the famous theme tune? Yeah. That's gold. Well there you go. Saw is still as sharp as ever and despite a few poor technical and narrative decisions, it comes as no surprise why a franchise was born. Low-budget thrills done right. As always, ""in Wan we trust""."
A pleasant surprise for strong stomachs!,6 March 2005,10.0,"Decided to catch ""Saw"" last Thanksgiving weekend. Paid for my ticket, got some popcorn, sat down and...oh...oh, my...OH-MY-GOD...BWAAHAHAHA-cough,cough,hack,snort(wheeeze)-THIS MOVIE TOTALLY %##&*%@% ROCKS! A truly demented, pleasing surprise for people(like me)who've practically despaired of seeing anything original on the big screen before it's sent off to the video purgatory!You think you've seen it all? This is Dario Argento multiplied! This is like the original version of ""The Vanishing""--no reassurance of a happy ending here, kids! The creators managed in eighteen days--ah, let me repeat that--EIGHTEEN %##&*%@% DAYS--to film what Mainstream Hollywood doesn't have the stones to make on its' own(Want to bet they're already making carbon copies of the ""Jigsaw Killer"" for their own pallid big money projects?). Everybody involved acquits themselves quite nicely in the terrifying, gory proceedings. Even Elwes' uneven accent somehow adds to the verisimilitude, especially when you realize that he's under pressure to HACK OFF HIS OWN FOOT OR ELSE. I'd have an uneven accent, too, under those conditions! Check it out--you won't regret it!"
Sawsome!!!,3 May 2023,10.0,"Two men awaken in a bathroom chained to pipes, they don't know each other and have no idea why they are there. They find themselves having to work together to try to find out who has done this to them and why. But as they start to piece things together, it appears that one of the men may know the perpetrator...I first watched this film when it was quite new and before I begun writing reviews and even though this is probably the 3rd time that I've seen this film it never fails to impress me...Even though it's tagged as a gore horror film (and in its very basic form I suppose that's what it is), but for me this film has layers to it that elevates it above your average 'gore horror film.' First of all, there's the man behind all the carnage; he's not your average lunatic who goes round murdering people willy-nilly without any kind of rhyme or reason, but rather he selects people whom he feels don't value life enough and effectively puts them through tests to determine their will to survive. This premise alone makes the film a cut above and gives it a sense of intelligence and sophistication that is rarely seen within this type of genre....So it has enough going for it to satisfy those with a thirst for blood, but it also works well as a crime mystery film, as a thriller and possibly even a police procedural type film. Whilst Dr Gordon and Adam are chained up trying to figure out who has put them there Detectives Tapp and Sing are also trying to do the same thing and the film nicely runs both stories side by side meaning that everyone is trying to work out who is doing this, but everyone is having to go about things in different ways. The first time you watch this film it's really fun trying to figure out how and where everyone slots in to the story and I really like the way the film gradually reveals slightly more information from scene to scene and it's fair to say that there is never a slow or dull moment in this film.The main actors are all solid as well; Elwes and Whannell worked exceptionally well together building up a good sort of anti-camaraderie. Glover is playing another cop, but he distinguishes himself from his Lethal Weapon and Predator 2 cop roles here as Tapp is a tortured-broken soul and Glover does a terrific job in this film (one of his best roles in my opinion). It doesn't hurt that the exceptionally pretty Monica Potter is involved in proceedings as well.Some may be put off by this film based on its name and reputation, but honestly this film is much more than just bloody carnage. If you peel it back you'll so many other layers that make it an incredibly enjoyable film for so many different reasons. Whilst the sequels gradually got worse, this first film is the granddaddy and is one of my favourite films and is definitely worth checking out.HONOURABLE MENTION: No matter how many times you see it, the ending is still brilliant."
"Macabre, magnificent plot... terrible acting",1 November 2005,7.0,"Let's start out on the good points, by saying how great the plot was. Original in the fact that it is a man who manipulates the chances of death for people, but does not kill. The many plot twists and storyline were intriguing and if all facets of this movie were done just as well, it could have been a great movie.However, the acting and pacing of the entire movie was lacking in my opinion. Conversation was stilted, the emotions lackluster at times or completely over the top. Hopefully these points are rectified in the sequel.Overall, it is at least worth one sitting."
This is a masterpiece addition to the horror genre,24 March 2023,7.0,"Saw (2004) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows two strangers that find themselves handcuffed to pipes in an abandoned warehouse basement. They have no idea who eachother are or why they are there. A monitor pops on and tells them they'll help them figure out the answers to those questions; but first, they're going to have to play a game...This movie is directed by James Wan (Dead Silence) and stars Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride), Leigh Whannell (Cooties), Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), Ken Leung (Old), Dina Meyer (Bords of Prey) and Shawnee Smith (The Blob).This movie is magnificently written, perfectly cast, fairly original and brilliantly uses background music to create intensity. The torture devices are fun as is the character's reactions to each circumstance. The dialogue is tremendous and there's some Se7en like sequences in this that make me smile every time I watch it. The kill scenes have tremendous gore and are like nothing before it. The conclusion is intense and very thoughtful.Overall, this was a masterpiece addition to the horror genre that is an absolute must see. I would score this a 9.5/10 and strongly recommend it."
An undisputed classic horror,23 March 2020,10.0,I just saw this for the first time and had to write a review. I absolutely loved this movie. It is so intelligent clever and very well crafted. Great acting by all the participants and a really intricate story. Seriously why cant all movies be clever as this? Hey Hollywood you could learn a lesson from this. I just found it really disturbing and yet I couldnt take my eyes off it. So twisty and scary. Definitely checking out all the sequels now. I will probably rewatch this again in a few months.
A GORY SUSPENSEFUL CHILLER,25 June 2020,10.0,"I have always loved this first Saw film, before the tons of sequels & the big franchise it became, because this flick was a gritty, grimy & grim serial killer Thriller that fit into the same category of those Awesome old school 1990's Thrillers like Kiss the Girls & The Bone Collector for example, Saw was a brutal & exciting movie.Now i really like the first sequel, Saw 2 but after that it's all abit over-the-top but Saw 2 is very good, but this first film is a glorious suspense filled murder mystery & we all know the scary story about two guys waking up in a grungy old room, chained up with no way out but lots of hidden clues for a way to escape but it will mean doing disturbing stuff.The visual look of Saw is excellent, sickly green moody cinematography & real gritty look & a great little cast all help this little low-budget flick make it's impact. We get the always great Danny Glover, a legend of Cinema with the Lethal Weapon films, here Glover plays an obsessed Detective on the trail of a sicko serial killer & he will stop at nothing to get the evil sicko. I've always loved Danny Glover in movies & grew up watching him on video with films such as the Lethal Weapon films, Predator 2, Gone Fishin' among other stuff & he really suits playing a tough Cop, so here it's great having his presence on screen as a hard detective & a comfort for us movie/genre fans to see old Glover with a gun again. The two captured men are both fine in their roles, especially Carrey Elwes (The Crush) but all the performances are actually really good & the atmosphere is always full of tension. I love low-budget Genre flicks & this is definitely a great one that deserves it's Cult Classic reputation. Saw is a gruesome, bloody & exciting nail biter of a Horror-Thriller."
The First Of The Series,6 March 2017,7.0,"The very first in a long and successful movie franchise, ""Saw"" has two extremely unfortunate guys (played by Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell) chained to pipes in a large, disgusting bathroom. From hazy memories and clues given to them in the room, they realize that they have been kidnapped by a serial killer named Jigsaw in order to play out a vicious, painful and bloody game in order to escape. Should the two men refuse to play, there will be severe consequences.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Saw"" is the scene when Elwes reaches his breaking point and uses a hacksaw to begin his escape. Although cringeworthy, it is mild compared to what future ""Saw"" movies has in store.""Saw"" works because 1) it moves fast thanks to a tight script and frenetic editing that can be annoying most times; 2) there is the mystery of who the serial killer is; and 3) it offers the audience very interesting and sadistic ways to kill the victims. Weaknesses of ""Saw"" are: 1) Elwes' often melodramatic, soap opera-ish acting; and 2) Danny Glover's cop character who makes one stupid move after another, making me wonder if he had a brain. Taken as a whole, ""Saw"" is an entertaining movie for fans of so called ""torture porn"" horror movies. Seeing the traps/puzzles alone is worth the price of admission.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
"A really great movie while watching, but I doubt I could watch it twice",11 April 2005,5.0,"Thriller about two guys who find themselves chained to opposite walls in an old shower room with a dead guy between them and the kidnapper playing riddles with them. The killer, who is never to be seen, sends them little messages, already hidden in their pockets or in places in the room. Messages like the one telling the Doctor that he has to kill the other guy within the next few hours or his wife and daughter will be killed. Messages like two hidden saws that they find that are not good enough to cut the chains around their ankles but definitely good enough to cut through those ankles. The doctor remembers having heard more about this killer, because he was once the main suspect himself. This killer loves to play such mind games where the abducted people usually end up killing themselves while trying to follow the game. Only one ever escaped. The movie is very tight, fast with a good story and I haven't found one second to catch my breath, and that for a movie of 100 minutes. I really enjoyed it (if one can say with such a grisly movie that one enjoyed it), but the strange thing is, I came out of the movie and boom it was gone. I didn't feel anything special afterwards, I wasn't stunned, scared, awed or whatever. It's like I have seen the movie 10 years ago, not 10 minutes ago. So I can't give it the 8 points that I would have given to it while it was on."
"Despite a good premise and signs of potential talent from James Wan, Saw completely falls apart in the last half-hour.",21 February 2005,5.0,"Rating: * 1/2 out of **** Opening to acclaim throughout a number of film festivals, Saw became the low-budget horror flick that came out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise. But hype has its backlash, and in my case, I can't say I came out of this film particularly impressed. There are elements in the film worth appreciating, but aside from a few tricky plot twists, it accomplishes nothing that other films haven't done before with more skill and freshness.Getting straight to the point, Saw opens with young photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) awakening in a bathtub, disoriented and confused towards his whereabouts. As it turns out, he's in a large, dank, grime-filled bathroom, chained to the pipes. He's got a chained companion on the other side of the room, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), and in between them lies the body of a dead man.Through a series of clues, Gordon deduces they're dealing with the ""Jigsaw,"" a serial killer who finds elaborate methods of forcing his victims to perform a series of grueling tasks, and if they fail, the penalty is death. A message left behind by tape informs Gordon of his task; he must kill Adam in eight hours or his own wife and child will be murdered.It's a good premise, but it's obvious the filmmakers aren't going to make a feature-length production set entirely within a bathroom. Unsurprisingly, it's the scenes set outside the bathroom that the movie first shows signs of faltering. Problem number one is that the sets appear rather low-grade, no surprise given the budgetary constraints. Problem number two is that the movie still wants to keep its villain's identity a surprise. In fact, I wasn't swayed at all upon the initial revelation of the killer, especially when this ""surprise"" is still juxtaposed alongside scenes set in the past where the filmmakers' still keep the killer's face hidden.Such twists and turns grow tiresome, all the more so when it's obvious that the killer always (and I mean ALWAYS) has a trick up his sleeve, making the final shock quite obvious moments before its underwhelming unveiling. Hey, I like my serial killer flicks to feature a smart villain as much as the next guy, but it's just plain annoying for them to be all-out omniscient.The scenes set within the bathroom are initially effective. The acting between Elwes and Whannell is convincing enough, with Whannell showing hints of genuine charisma that could serve him well in the future. But all this takes a flabbergasting nose-dive in the last half-hour, beginning with the cigarette scene. It was by this point I wondered if director James Wan was winking at us because prior to this the film was serious in its intent to scare.I can't help but admit that this far into the picture, I started laughing and couldn't stop. I was willing to suspend my disbelief at a lot of the plot, even at the fact that five hours could suddenly pass and catch up on the protagonists (surely, at least one of them would keep better track of the time?), but that the killer would know that at least one of the two men would look inside his wallet and find the right picture and message, and to be aware of how desperate one of them is for a smoke in even such a dank environment and have a back-up plan to test the possible contingency that could result; well, I have to say, it felt like a parody of all the ""smart"" serial killer flicks we've seen before, and the acting only goes further to serve that belief.Decent at first, Elwes goes off the deep end in the movie's climax. One has to question how someone would truly respond in such a situation, so I'm not going to criticize his acting in that respect. I just can't deny that my immediate response was pure hilarity; Elwes is not a very good actor, but he's competent enough for me to believe he was perfectly aware of how silly he looked and overplayed it for all it was worth. Considering the absence of suspense, I think the laughs go a step or two in making up for it.Also, without giving too much away, there must have been other ways for a certain character to resolve his predicament (like seeking help) if the danger that's posed upon him is slow-acting enough for an incredibly elaborate plan to unfold over the course of many hours. The danger is, in fact, so slow-acting that after all those hours, this man (who should not be a very skilled fighter or marksman) is still capable of engaging and holding his own in shootouts, chases, and fistfights with a crazed and determined ex-cop. Director Wan has potential, but he needs to lay off on camera tricks and realize quick cuts and sped-up camera-work serve as distractions and do little to build genuine scares or suspense. In fact, I was surprised by how easy it was for me to sit through this film. At no moment did I ever feel a sense of dreadful anticipation like I do with the best (or even solidly competent) of the genre. Much of the reason for that has to do with the flashback structure, we're clearly aware of who's alive or who isn't considering we know who's telling the story. It doesn't help that each twist spirals the movie further into a hole it can't dig itself out of, the final strike coming in the last moments with a preposterous surprise revelation. We barely saw this guy prior to this scene, so why make a big deal out of this surprise by going through a pointless flashback? This is one case where an otherwise middling movie is destroyed by a terrible ending."
God Damn!!,1 August 2021,10.0,"I absolutely love the Saw movies. Granted, they do get a bit complex in terms of plot and it turns into a soap opera with a side of bloody traps, nothing can beat the original Saw."
A good Seven style thriller with some interesting ideas.,5 November 2005,10.0,"Saw is a very good thriller, with some excellent twists and good looking production design. It's got some absolutely fantastic set pieces and an excellent villain in the shape of the Jigsaw Killer. I enjoyed it, and saw it as a fantastic, slick piece of entertainment.However, I had some issues with it. For one, the acting is pretty suspect. No worse than a lot of other indie thrillers, and streets ahead of some, but many of the actors turn in OTT or stereotypical turns that stopped me from truly immersing myself in the atmosphere.I found that I also wasn't as gripped as my colleagues when we finally sat down to watch the film. I loved certain parts of it, especially the girl in the reversed bear trap and the section in Leigh Whannels apartment, but most of the film I felt was too slick for it's own good. The movie lacks the suffocating atmosphere that makes films like Session 9, Seven and My Little Eye so disturbing and memorable, and plumps instead for a Hollywood-style atmosphere reminiscent of movies like Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer and Red Dragon. This detracts from the impact of the horror elements.Still, the plot is great, and I genuinely didn't work out whodunnit until the final reveal. Though the movie won't hold many shocks or horrors for genre vets, it's still a satisfyingly meaty film with a lot of gruesome scenes and dark ideas. Saw doesn't quite make the greatest hits list of thrillers or horror, but it's a good solid film nonetheless with a lot to offer."
Hot Dance of Horror,31 March 2019,9.0,"This is the one that you got to watch from the whole Saw franchise: some unique ideas, some gore, some suspense. The 2nd movie is also a good one, but not as strong as the first one. After Saw 2 the stories told got more and more confusing and repetitive and boring.Saw: unique and a fresh approach on the art of horror at the time first published."
top notch thriller with an intriguing screenplay!!!,16 March 2005,9.0,"SAW, is a movie which made me see it more than once .it gives an entirely different viewpoint when watched the second time.it makes us wonder how could have the writer come with such a plot.the movie begins with 2 men waking up in a abandoned bathroom with their feet chained and it moves with the clues they pick up in recursion ..the acting is good at certain points but the viewer has to stay a bit calm and involved to get the plot going...the screenplay is done so well that it all sets up for an excellent ending .. most of the people would get a feeling of ""FLIGHT JUST AT THE POINT OF TAKE OFF"" when the movie ends... i thoroughly enjoyed the movie ,of course i saw it alone ... i would definitely give it a 9/10.."
Ooh i like,7 March 2005,7.0,"I really enjoyed this film! I hope that doesn't make me sound crazy, as it is quite a freaky film. But i thought it was well filmed, good acting and a good idea.Not many films scare me, especially ones with frantic stabbing and bloodyness, so i thought this film would be mostly blood and stuff...but it was so good, it was really twisted and it psychologically messes with you..as well as some of the blood lolAnd i must say, that white mask thing with the red circles on its cheeks scared me so bad!! Lol, every time it came on the screen i winced...eww creepy. It specially scared me when it came out of the darkness, after that girl got the key outta the man's body to save herself. Lord that was scary. Yes and the ending is fabulous! Watch this film! Unless you get scared easily..or don't like weird, creepy things..."
Refreshing directorial debut let down by dire acting,5 October 2004,7.0,"To cut straight to the point, Saw is an original and refreshing horror movie. It's premise - where people are put in potentially fatal situations by a twisted psychopath in order to appreciate their lives if they survive - is an interesting one. The psychopath in question, the 'Jigsaw' killer, is a good creation. His puppet-messenger is truly disturbing (especially if you were scared of ventriloquists dummies when you were younger), and there are moments in the film of real tension. For a first film, hats must go off to the two young writers, one of whom stars in (Leigh Whannell) and the other who directs the film (James Wan).The film could have been a superb horror flick, but it really is let down by some appalling acting. And the main culprits should be ashamed: step forward Mr Glover and Mr Elwes. These guys have been around, yet they turn in performances worthy of teenage drama classes only. Bad drama classes. Cary Elwes especially is abysmal. His performance elicited laugh-out-loud moments from the audience from people like me who could not believe that this guy does this for a living. It is so unfortunate that much of the film's final act hinges on Elwes, because instead of sending us reeling and shocked form what is undoubtedly a fine twist at Saw's end, we only emerge ruefully chuckling to ourselves and wondering just how good this movie might have been if an actor of any kind of ability had replaced Elwes.If you like your horror fresh, twisted and dark, see Saw. Just prepare yourself to feel a little blunted by it's performers.Rating ** and a half (out of five)"
I Know What You Did...,23 January 2005,10.0,"Genres always exist, become living things, for a reason. A popular genre is the guy (or demon) who has the some omniscience and the ability to either create intricate scenarios which always work flawlessly. Often this is a serial killer.The reason for the genre comes from some unavoidable facts in fiction. You have the writer who _is_ omniscient and _does_ have the capability of creating complex scenarios that do work. It is the writer's world after all. And we have the reader who occupies a place between the characters in the story (with whom we relate) and the writer (because we see and know things the characters cannot).So it is a natural thing to propose a character that also occupies this space. I'm making a study of the complex ways we've evolved to do perform this trick. But one way is very simple: just have a character with these qualities, period. For some reason (an ability to impute Lucifer?), we accept this more readily if the god-like character is ""evil.""Right, them. The game in this genre is one that grew up in the detective genre, indeed, there is often a detective still remaining in most editions of the genre. The game is a struggle among the three: you the viewer, the writer and the god-like demon to outsmart each other in the giving life to the world we see.So, built in to the genre is the final twist. We know it is there, it is a structural necessity. All parties know it is there. An entry in the genre is judge on only one factor: how successfully did the bad guy (not the writer) flummox the viewer? All else is filler, usually noisy or grisly to distract us from the fact that it _is_ filler.So how did this film do? Not well enough to fool me. But then, I know the game. And I must be evil.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
One of the best mystery thriller. Ain't no torture porn.,29 May 2016,10.0,"Why do I want to write the review now on SAW ? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. I saw this movie for the first time in 2005. I have yet to see a movie that has brought such intensity. The music, from Charlie Clouser, is just brilliant. It has that sort of dark, rough edge to it. An excellent soundtrack that keeps the heart racing as the victims running outta time. Da da daa. Da da daa was perfect for this kinda flick. Pretty low-budget and filmed in just a few days. Kudos to the makers James Wan and Leigh Whannell. Subsequent to my viewing of 'Saw', I went on to watch all 6 sequels. Unfortunately, all the other sequels weren't able to recapture the charm of the first one except for the 6th, which was decent.It has an ending that I didn't see coming at all. The best ending since Usual suspects. Many ppl will complain that Sixth sense had it but I wud difffer as Stir of echoes had similar. At least the story for Stir of echoes, appeared long before The Sixth Sense, in Richard Matheson's 1958 novel. Saw ain't no torture porn like many ppl believe. It's one of the best mystery thriller. The film stars Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Michael Emerson, Ken Leung, Tobin Bell and Leigh Whannell."
Good Horror Movie,11 August 2006,7.0,"'Saw' was better than I expected. From the name and the genre, I was expecting something akin to 'House of 1000 corpses' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. I found 'Saw' to be a step above these movies. It had an interesting intellectual component that left one guessing about a central mystery. (This mystery involved how the characters got into, and will get out of, their predicament.) I found the performances, dialog and character decisions to be believable - which is unusual for this genre. I was also surprised to see that there were some fairly well-known actors in the movie such as Danny Glover and Dina Meyer. I was impressed with the quality of movie that was created given a limited budget. Although a definite step above most horror movies, I wouldn't recommend the movie to the average viewer unless one likes the Horror genre. In that case - definitely catch this one."
One of the Most Brilliant Horror Films Ever.,3 July 2013,7.0,"You wake up. You're in room with two other guys. One of them is dead. You are trapped to the wall by a chain on your ankle. You have no idea how you got there. Imagine that. Now imagine that getting much, much worse. And you have Saw. Saw is brilliant. It has no cheap twists or turns. No clich√©s, which are often unavoidable in the genre. And the whole film, as a horror flick, is a refreshing break from the plentiful jump scares that other films are so prominent in using. This film is frightening. It is gruesome. It is creepy. You never find that in horror films nowadays. Even in the sequels that follow this film, they are burdened by cheap and exhausted trends that, yes, may be frightening, but never do they leave you thinking ""I didn't see that coming"" or simply leave you with your jaw hanging as much as this film does. Saw also benefits from it's truly human characters. Characters that are flawed, troubled and real. Characters who move along the way with you. Instead of the classic ""Don't open closet, don't open the closet"" feel you get from some movies, Saw puts you there with character, totally okay with opening the closet until you realize it was an awful decision. The entire film digs at you, unsettles you, makes absolutely sure that your uneasy. It doesn't hesitate in pulling the carpet from under your feet. So many horror films make you chase them. They make you panic for answers. You are scared. Saw doesn't do this however. Saw grabs you by the ankle and drags you in until your just as captive as it's characters. You are amazed. Watching Saw alone, in the dark, late at night is how it should be watched. Otherwise you'll miss the full experience that this film proves to be. To all you horror fans out there, go watch this movie right now. To all of those who don't enjoy horror films, swallow the lump in your throat and do the same."
A necessity for horror enthusiasts,12 April 2020,9.0,"I do think this is a smart movie; it started the ""strangers trapped together her and have to work together to get out"" concept. Even though Leigh Whannel (spelling might be wrong) Doesn't act that well, you can see his fear, along with everyone else's. Not the most gruesome of the series. The twist at the end is one you didn't know to begin with but then you're like ""omg totally makes sense now"". This series is a fun one to watch, all the blood and gore. It is a classic among horror films. Definitely a necessity for horror enthusiasts to watch!"
See Saw,21 March 2016,9.0,"The infamous torture porn movie that is Saw. This horror movie serves as more than just a sketch show of creative and elaborate traps rigged to kill those in its way, it is essentially a psychological mystery thriller about two men piecing together how they came to be the latest victims in a puppets game whilst also solving the puzzle that is... the identity of Jigsaw killer.The film is of course unsettling and disturbing, It's a torture porn horror film after all. The film successfully creates this uncomfortable feeling with the use of creative camera-work, good direction, nauseous plot points and (fortunately) minimal jump scares.Would you like to play a game? Let's play count the flashbacks. The film is overly reliant on the use of flashbacks that the film even contains flashbacks within flashbacks. The infamous Head trap is one of these inception like flashbacks.One other issue I had with the film was the poor/ lack of explanation for major plot points. The key in the bathtub at the very start of the film as well as the reasons for why Adam and Dr Gordon are in this situation as they haven't really done anything wrong. These plot points could have been explained far better then they were so that audience members can actually understand key moments and back story of the film.Overall Saw is a disturbing, creative and scary film that like many good horror films would subject itself to a string of sequels each one worse than the other. But it would not have happened if not for this successful horror thriller that will leave you both disturbed and intrigued to see the next instalment"
For Those Who Love to Laugh and Puke at the Same Time...,1 November 2004,7.0,"""Saw"" is relentlessly grisly. The serial-killer genre has been run into the ground recently, but ""Saw"" grinds it into mush and churns it out kicking and screaming once again. Here, the killer never really kills anyone, he simply sets up overly elaborate and grotesque scenarios that leave his hapless victims with painful choices, die a horrible death, kill yourself first, or kill someone else to escape. What we get here as viewers, is some of the best hardcore horror gore splattering this side of the latest zombie-fest.""Saw"" has everything a hardcore cult classic of this ilk needs to stand the test of time. The director, James Wan, is a hapless slap-dash hack (the editing is especially horrible) with a lovingly perverse penchant for the grotesque and macabre. Hardcore horror fans will rejoice. The film's set-ups are clever, and its executions are over the top. The film is anchored by a screamingly bad lead performance from Cary Elwes. All the performances here (save for the creepy tape-recorded voice of the Jigsaw killer) are terrible, but Elwes (who always seems to be acting as if he is still in ""The Princess Bride"") has some of the most howlingly awful sobbing/screaming scenes I have ever seen. Once you get done puking, you will laugh, as most of the audience did. I don't think the laughs are intentional, but by george, they are surely needed, because the last piece of the cult-classic-status puzzle is the stomach-churning ending. The last ten minutes of the film give us such a perverse twist, that it will leave the viewer shell-shocked. Don't expect a nice tidy ending. The film is as sloppy as its director, but the climax is as insanely ingenious as the killer it depicts. I was shocked, and so were the hardcore fans I went with, and that is saying a lot. So, if you are like us, see ""Saw"", otherwise, I can't recommend this gnarly hack-work to anyone else."
Scary movie??,19 April 2005,7.0,"Unfortunately, the lowest I can go on the rating scale is a 1. Never have I seen a movie with such a GREAT premise and promising directing lose so much because of the acting. Carey Elwes was extremely disappointing for such a seasoned actor. I mean this was suppose to be a scary movie and I couldn't help but laugh at the over dramatized way Elwes told Wannell he would send help to get him. Wannell's work wasn't nearly as bad and he's a newcomer. Overall, this could have been a great movie given some better actors, major script adjustment and WAY more than 18 days to shoot. I mean give me a break!!! You've got two guys chained at the ankle on either side of what appears to be a bathroom and a (supposedly) dead guy in the middle of the floor and you're telling me that neither of them, one being a doctor, notice that he's breathing?!?!?!? What did he do, hold his breath for 8 hours?!?!?!?Comparing this movie to Se7en and Silence of the Lambs is just plain ridiculous. Sam Raimi did a better job with The Evil Dead his first time around.The only thing scary about this movie was the acting."
Incredible horror,19 July 2019,9.0,"Despite the franchise it created, Saw is a film with minimal gore and all the better for it. Closer to Se7en than its own sequels with a focus on the psychological toll of being in one of Jigsaw's traps rather than revelling in the execution. It's a bleak, twisty thriller that's constantly changing and satisfyingly unpredictable.Cary Elwes is terrific here, trying to maintain his calm in a horrible situation but when it does get to him he's phenomenal at portraying the desperation. With less experience Leigh Whannell is obviously not as strong and yet still he's still able to go toe to toe with Elwes for the majority of the film.James Wan's direction uses the low budget so well with an idea that plays into the smaller scale and it only exceeds its limitations for a very brief car chase. Considering its mostly confined to one location, Wan brings an impressive amount of dynamism with some gloriously 2000s editing.The main set is just phenomenal, almost too convincing at being disgustingly dirty which makes everything feel even more gross. Charlie Clouser's score does so much with just one major theme, waiting until the very end to unleash it, making a great ending even better."
"""I want to play a game"".",12 July 2014,9.0,"That is the tag line for this movie. You will be hearing this continuously throughout the movie before each victim of ""The Jigsaw Killer"" has to escape their test.Saw is a psychological thriller created in 2004 by James Wan and Leigh Whannell who also is one of the lead actors in this. If you read a little bit of back story on these two, they decided to try to make a film fresh out of high school. Saw was the result and what a result it was!Saw has so many twists and turns that I will say nothing about the plot. All I will say is that this is a great psychological thriller and will keep you guessing. There have been 6 sequels after this and I will be reviewing all of them as I love this series.The soundtrack is also very well done. The ending theme is superb.Great job James and Leigh. Keep it up!"
"Good, but not great. It's hard to be bored during 'Saw'",11 October 2004,9.0,"This movie really had a chance to be a great film. The opening scenes, and many scenes in the film, are creatively very interesting and original, with a grainy look throughout that is reminiscent of 'Se7en'. The acting leaves a little to be desired, but the plot itself is first-rate stuff, with few mistakes, although of course there are always a few goofs, but it's easy enough to swallow. Beware that some of the characters may seem a little stupid, but oh, well. Take it in stride.Captivation is the key word here, in the world of 'Saw' and in the viewers themselves. You *will* be interested, and you'll want to see how it all turns out.Spoilers are definitely a no-no for this film - please see it with no previous knowledge, and you will be rewarded. There are many other movies that are more intelligent than this, but it's acceptable fare in comparison to what's served today, and well worth seeing at least once.Don't pass this up - one of the best of the season for horror fans.6.8 out of 10"
"Thin Plotting, Heavy Execution.",12 April 2007,7.0,"To start off, I'm not too joyous about the streaming abrogating responses this film has received. So it's not the best horror film of the year, big deal. Personally I'd say this film differs from many other Hollywood blockbuster big budget or low budget horror flicks out there. It's a grueling and disgusting film in the eyes of the average viewer, but to some one else, you can see how these petty criminals portrayed in the film cleverly and affectingly pull together a wicked trap or two. The sadistic torture in the film is straight to the core and doesn't resist. This is very charming, in a lurid way. The pacing in the film immediately picks up, as we get to know two of the main characters in the film. Not a whole load of character study here, more explanations and reasons, this makes way for the weak plot that needs some comeuppance. Many plots have been done in this cosmopolitan way, but not many knew where to go from here. This film doesn't just feature irritating scenes of brutal torture, tacky characters and forced on writing, instead they tried something different with the formula they are strained to bond with. To give simple yet justified examples of how realistic and original the forms of torture are in this film, I don't mean how gory they are. I mean how powerful and intriguing they are. Some mysterious and some you catch on too easily. For example, one man, gets his energy in a sickening way, pretending to shoot a person with a gun, so he can hear her heart beat. Sounds a little basic, but when you think about it, all serial killers need is to hear your screams, and that gives them enough pulse. You may retract at some of the violent scenes you'll experience throughout the coarse of this film, but it'll pass. Nothing to gruesome. You'll notice, most of the characters are very energetic, and come to life on the big screen. This is produced not only by the dignified roles, but surprisingly by the actors too. Nothing is exploited for more than it is in this film, everything is too the highest quality and purity. I guarantee it's very suspenseful and will shock and befuddle you at times, with enough pulse pounding axiomatic thrills to satisfy. Overall, originality and regenerated execution is key here.2.5 of 4 Stars"
One of the best horror movies of the 2000's,18 February 2015,7.0,"The sequels weren't that good but in my opinion, this is one of the better horror movies of the 2000's. As the film continues on, it gets more tense and the different traps make more tension. As soon as it starts, Adam and Dr. Lawrence start recalling incidents so they can figure out what happened to them and who put them there. It's a great look into human survival and it covers the depths of insanity as they start to turn on each other. I know it's excessively gory at some parts so this is not for everyone but most horror fans would probably like it. Also, at the final 5 minutes, its twist ending will knock you cold. Accompanied, by the epic score, your heart will be racing beyond belief. I'm not going to spoil the ending because it must be witnessed start to finish to be fully appreciated. But, thinking about the true nature of it, makes it more terrifying. Unfortunately, all the other sequels weren't able to recapture the charm of the first one but if you want an epic, gore-filled, tense story about survival then you'll likely enjoy this one as long as you can get past the gore."
Horror movie..... with a story!,17 August 2021,8.0,This horror movie has a mystery duriing all the movie: its the two strangers guys who are chained together and they try to know why and they will find soon that they are not very strangers. A very cult movie. It has great moments and can be very gore too. The movie have an investigation part and its not a full horror movie. We can follow policeman in their investigation to stop the guy behind all of this.
Are you quite Saw?,21 June 2014,8.0,"Whenever I write a review my conscience tells me to think of all the talented people who put so much time and effort into their project. ""Be fair"" I hear it say. On the other hand, thinking of the readers of these reviews, there are times when a dose of brutal honesty is the only option.Director James Wan and actor Leigh Wannell co-wrote Saw, therefore they have to accept the burden of culpability for what I can only describe as one of the worst films I have ever seen. This is quite remarkable considering that the opening denouement promises so much as we find Mr Wannell waking up to a living nightmare. He and fellow actor Cary Elwes find themselves chained by the ankles on either side of what can only be described as the bathroom from Hell with what is presumably a dead body between them. The only clean object is a clock on the wall. Ticking. We look forward to a psychological drama......what we get instead is a convoluted story centred on a character known as Jigsaw, a sadistic evildoer who gives his victims the chance of life if they are willing to sacrifice others. This is explained to us via flashbacks... lots of flashbacks. This gives us the opportunity to see Ken Leung as Detective Sing and his partner Danny Glover as Detective Tapp in a double act straight from the Lethal Weapon school of acting - which is actually remarkably good compared with our two leads trapped in the bathroom who are gradually running through every emotional gamut in an effort to convince us of... What? Well, this is where the problem lies. We have spent one fifth of the running time trying to establish characters, plot, development, direction. We have nothing. Mr Elwes, playing the part of a surgeon and Mr Wannell as a down-at-heel photographer have both tried tension-breaking comedic, breaking-down emotional and shouty. We shall leave them for a while as they bond, fall out, solve clues, fail miserably to escape before their deadline etc. Meanwhile we can continue with the flashbacks and find out just how easy it is for our two inept detectives to bond, solve clues and go after the homicidal maniac all on their own...Oh by the way, did I mention Zep, the rather sinister hospital orderly, or John, Dr. Gordon's patient with an inoperable frontal lobe tumour. How about the good doctor's wife Alison and daughter Diana? Well they all pop up in the inevitable flashbacks. Eventually everybody, doctor,wife, daughter, policeman who is still alive, photographer, patient, extremely patient reviewer get together in a Grand Guignol finish... Oh sorry - you want me to save one-hundred minutes of your life? Here goes. Doctor has to kill photographer by six o'clock in order to save his wife and daughter who are being held by orderly who has been poisoned by maniac who will only give him antidote if he kills doctor's wife and daughter. Detective, who went insane after maniac killed his partner, is paying photographer to follow doctor who he thinks is maniac. Orderly fails to follow through due to not tying doctor's wife properly, detective arrives, fights orderly, speeded-up car chase a la Keystone Kops - no idea why. Both end up in the sewers, detective dies. Doctor loses concentration, realises it is now gone six. saws through his own ankle, shoots photographer but fails to kill him. Drags himself out of bathroom. Reviewer loses concentration. What we thought was a dead body in the bathroom turns out to be patient John aka Jigsaw who gets up and kindly tells photographer that key to padlock is in bath - same bath that photographer emptied of water at beginning of film thus leaving him trapped there. John/Jigsaw leaves.To sum up: a film with sadistic overtones, poor acting, what we can only presume to be an unfinished script, ludicrous plot and loose ends inevitably leading to sequels which, fortunately for all of us I shall not be either viewing or reviewing.Whilst IMDb offer no clues as to the ages of reviewers I feel fairly confident in declaring that most of the people who give this film a vote of seven or more would be below thirty. It would be interesting to see what would happen if they all came back in twenty years and revised their votes..."
Who wins?,30 October 2005,8.0,"Before I saw this film, I'd heard it was messed up, but I figured I'd probably seen worse. I'd sat through Se7en, with it's implied razor-dildo scene, the twitching and general creepiness of the original Ring films, and god knows what else.Saw is, however, something else.I'm not even sure if it's entertainment. I just sat on the edge of my seat for nearly two hours, waiting for it to be over and everything to be alright again. As a horror film it works fantastically well; it holds its audience, is next to unguessable, and frequently throws out scenes that make you jump. It also engages its audience really well and I don't think I've ever screamed so much at the screen watching a film; never have I wanted a bad guy to cop it in the most gruesome way so much and been left so consitently frustrated.In keeping with the recent trend in horror flms, the end leaves you with nothing. Nobody wins. Most of the characters end up dead. I suppose we can be glad the kid wasn't shot, but then some guy hacked off his own ankle, which kinda evens that out. It's frustrating because it's so well made but just...eats away at your soul for two hours. It causes no lasting damage, but you come away wondering what sort of mind could come up with something like this. And then make a sequel. And announce a third.Clever, well-made, exciting and scary, Saw is definitely worth watching and creates a lasting impression."
Very unpleasant but it IS a horror film,13 November 2004,8.0,"Grim, sadistic story of a maniac who tortures people in various ways. He gives them ways to live but they have to do something morally wrong to get that. One woman has a device that will rip her jaw open. The key is inside the stomach of a live man--she has to cut it out of him. In this one two men are chained to pipes on either side of a disgusting bathroom. Between them is a dead body. The killer leaves them clues to free themselves---but if that don't do it in an allotted amount of time--they'll be left to rot there and die.The film is grim, dark and extremely disturbing. There's not one bit of humor in it--it's very much like the movie ""Se7en"". The acting is superb and the tension builds slowly. The final act is very violent, brutal and does NOT have a happy ending. I was left shaking but it scared me---and that's exactly what a horror film should do. The only negative it left room (sigh) for a SEQUEL! But that's to be expected nowadays.Worth seeing for horror fans with strong stomaches but brace yourself. I give it an 8."
Creepy!,3 March 2005,7.0,"""Saw"" is a morality tale to the extreme. The question ""What would you do to stay alive"" is constantly posed through the movie. 2 men, Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannelle, who also helped with the screenplay)wake up in a room, each with a chain on their foot. A creepy voice tells the doctor that he has to make a choice: Kill Adam by 6 or his wife and child will die. Through a series of flashbacks, we find out that Dr. Gordon was originally a suspect in a series of grisly murders dubbed ""The Jigsaw Murders."" Funny thing is, the victims aren't murdered, but are manipulated by the serial killer to do themselves in. Many of the ""murders"" are graphic (This one individual had to climb through heavy duty barbed wire in order to escape). Danny Glover plays a detective that becomes obsessed with the case (And has his own battle scars dealing with the killer). The ending is jaw dropping and you just KNOW that a sequel would have to be made (TOO many unanswered question!). By the time the credits roll, you wonder if YOU would do the same to stay alive.For true horror buffs and for those who want a good scare."
Saw,21 August 2021,7.0,"I've never seen any of the Saw films until now, and I'm glad I did. This wasn't what I was entirely expecting, but it was a pleasant surprise, understanding now, the high praise around it."
Better than average but not perfect thriller/horror,12 May 2006,10.0,"Saw is one of those sort of movies where the less said about it the better.... but the whole plot surrounds two men who wake up chained in a dirty bathroom who soon discover they are playing a psychopath's game where the only way to escape is for one man to kill the other...Saw is a pretty interesting movie for the most part - with heaps of plot twists and ""killer"" scenes - it delivers the requisite thrills and chills that a good horror/thriller movie should.Some of the scenes are just soo squirming disturbing - it should have the horror fans begging for more...But for all its pluses - I find that the acting in Saw is a little undercooked. Leigh Whannell, an ex-Australian TV presenter feels a little out of his depth in the more emotional scenes (not to mention that his accent seems to drop in and out of being Aussie) and Cary Elwes character seems to go from ""perfectly sane"" to ""insanely mad"" in about two seconds at the climax of the film. That moment (and you would know it if you have seen the movie) - just doesn't gel like it should...But despite it flaws - Saw is a pretty good movie (for those into gutwrenching horror stuff)..."
Good...Not Great.,19 September 2005,10.0,"My only complaint with this movie is Cary Elwes.Danny Glover...unlike in Predator 2...does an exceptional job, but Cary Elwes...nothing against his acting ability. He's exceptionally talented. And he clearly does his best.He's just too Mr. Rogers for this role. I think perhaps his casting was intended to provide a kind of sense that this could happen to anyone. Even the most innocent well-intended character.But I don't know. He didn't seem to fit the role.Aside from the casting, however, this movie rules, and that's why I'm giving it an 8 out of 10. The ""bad guy"" is unbelievable...one of the smartest and coolest mad geniuses I've seen in a movie for...a while.And the ending...well... it will surprise you. And the last line is something you'll be quoting for weeks afterward.Go see it."
"Implausible, irritating and full of plot holes",9 July 2006,7.0,"The current rating for this horror film indicates it is one of the greatest of all time. Give me a break! It's not even close. Unless you are VERY forgiving of glaring plot holes, bad acting, annoying dialogue, ""trendy"" rapid fire MTV-style editing, lame ""edgy"" industrial music soundtracks and a pathetic ""moral"" justification for murder delivered by a psycho obviously copied from Kevin Spacey's Se7en character, then you might be amongst the people who think this is something special. But if you're like me and take a more analytical approach to these thrillers, this thing simply falls apart at the seams and leads up to a surprise twist so implausible and unbelievable it must be seen to be believed. Not only this, but the film refuses to stay in one place for long. It jumps from the main story (leads Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell chained up in a bathroom and trying to figure a way to escape) about five times too many to maintain the suspense. We get to see bits and pieces of the police investigation and the killer terrorizing the wife and daughter of Elwes' doctor character. Said wife acts like a complete and utter moron even after the killer sticks a gun in her daughters face.It's not a great movie. It's not even a good movie. It's just a pedestrian thriller all jazzed up with tricky editing, jump cuts, some gore and loud music to appeal to the teenagers and intellectually stunted adults in the audience. Anyone with a brain, however, will find it hard to swallow and not worth the effort at all."
Sadistic nonsense that panders to those seeking thrills over logic.,28 December 2006,7.0,"Just when I thought ""Copycat"" and ""Nightwatch"" couldn't be ""topped"" in the serial-killer genre, comes this piece of garbage straight out of the pen of a cretin. Either that or he considers every potential viewer to be a cretin. This nonsense has so many gaping holes in logic that it looks like a filmic version of Swiss cheese, and has more far-fetchedness than I've seen in years. Stylish? Yes, but does that even begin to make up for a plot so ridiculous it could have been written by Ed Wood's nostril in a nano-second? It is rare that I so give up on a movie that I have to fast-forward certain scenes to get it over with. Check out the mind-bogglingly dumb ending: one of the dumbest in the history of ALL cinema. What's next? A serial-killer who kills million people a day, looks like a giraffe, jumps like a kangaroo, and lives on Mars?"
A true suspense thriller,23 December 2006,1.0,"Saw in my opinion is an excellent suspense thriller/horror film. Many people pick it apart for several different reasons, and while i admit it may have it's flaws, i believe the important thing about a movie is the effect it has on you while watching it, rather than what you get when you pick apart every single little detail, and this particular film blew me away.It's somewhat of a slow builder, but that's one of the things that makes it so good. It introduces the characters and keeps you interested in what's happening to them and how they interact with each other. You feel like you're there with them the whole time throughout their ordeal, and it makes you care about the characters.Some of the scenes in this movie are truly suspenseful. One in particular will have you on the edge of your seat, not wanting to even breathe, and then even though you should be able to guess what happens at the end of the scene, it will still make you jump.other scenes will make you laugh right before throwing in something completely unexpected.and after all of the excellent, gripping build up, all hell finally breaks loose in the end, leading up to one of the best horror film endings i have ever seen.This is an exciting movie that will get your heart racing, and i gave it a 10/10. i recommend everybody who's into psychological thrillers and who don't mind a little excess blood see this film."
A game you have no choice to be a part of,28 February 2007,1.0,"Can you imagine being a part of somebody's sick and demented game that could result in your death? Adam (Leigh Whannel) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) were just that. They both woke up in a room in some unknown building, chained to pipes with a dead man on the floor. In that room were all the clues and tools they needed to escape, or risk perishing there; all they had to do was find them.""Saw"" was one twisted movie but it was well done. The movie held you in suspense throughout while also interweaving the necessary background information that lead the two pawns to their current situation. Saw was made effective by having an appealing multi-layered plot. There was the cop trying to catch Jigsaw (the bad guy), there were the two guys in the room trying to get out, and of the two guys, one guy in the room also needed to save his family, and on top of all that you are trying to figure out just who the bad guy was.I was completely engrossed in this movie. I wanted to see the two guys survive and I desperately wanted the mastermind behind the whole sick scheme to be caught, and preferably tortured. This was one of those thrillers where you had a true rooting interest in seeing the antagonist either caught or destroyed. Every suspense or thriller has an antagonist, but not many have one that you can really loathe and pray for his demise. ""Saw"" effectively combined the suspense of whether or not the two main characters would survive along with the suspense of whether or not the bad guy would be caught. This was a well done movie, and even though the ending infuriated me to no end, it was a great twist."
The Start Of Torture P*rn,13 March 2020,8.0,"Look, this movie started a lot of intense and very gory horror movies. I will say that the only reason I'm not giving this a 6/10 is because of the fact that this movie was made because the people making it said. Hey, what if we made a horror movie that takes place in one room. Without seeing the sequels I am confident that they're better. The problem with this movie is that although they show the other victims of Jigsaw, we don't have any reason to care. Saw is mainly about 2 people, kidnapped and trapped in one room. Trying to get out. Many of the editing in this movie is just sped up creepy montages, but I am still going to give this one a 7. Don't know if I will ever watch the sequels, but this is a must watch for any horror fan, even if parts of it don't make a lot of sense."
' so I saw Saw last night...',2 January 2006,9.0,"Clever, highly intense horror-thriller is one of the most intelligently done killer thrillers in years.Two men awaken to discover that they are chained inside a dilapidated old restroom, having fallen into the hands of a murderer who likes to play deadly games with his victims.Well-written and tightly directed, Saw is a truly dark and nerve-grinding kind of suspense thriller. From it's mysterious opening to it's twisted, shocking finale it is a high-powered shocker that's sure to draw in any viewer. It packs plenty of chilling sequences, eerie atmosphere, and references to some old-school horror films.The cast isn't bad. Cary Elwes does a good performance as a trapped doctor who is desperate to save his family from the madman. Leigh Whannell (who co-wrote the film) is great as a photographer who's also caught up in the madness. Veteran actor Danny Glover is perfect as a police detective determined to find the killer.An unforgettable horror film all around, Saw is not to be missed.*** 1/2 out of ****"
Gruesome but effective horror film,28 February 2006,9.0,"Saw was a disturbing film with some really gruesome scenes. This movie was definitely a psychological beat down in my experience of watching it. The over the top acting was a little too much, but it got its point across.This is a movie about a serial killer named Jigsaw. He wants to teach certain amoral people how to value life, but he does so in such a horrifying way that his victims must overcome vicious tests where they either do what they need to survive or die because they didn't try hard enough. With his tests there is always a way out, but it is up to the victims to show how far they will go to survive.Dark and disturbing, with very little hope for it characters, this was one of the most depressing horror movies I've ever seen. Nothing more to say. I may not have liked this movie very much, but I mean that in a good way. When you see the movie you will know why."
"An amazing, slick, sick whodunnit",8 April 2006,7.0,"Less a horror than a slick, sick whodunnit, this amazing film certainly has it all: scares, shocks and twists. Basically, photographer Leigh Whannell (who also co-wrote the script) wakes up chained by the ankle to a bathroom wall. Chained to the other end is doctor Cary Elwis. They soon realise they are playing one of the ""Jigsaw"" killer's sick games, in which he teaches the victims how much life is worth.High on logic and (reasonably) low on gore, James Wan and Leigh Whannell seem to unmask the killer pretty early on in the film, before cleverly misdirecting you. Although the film is pretty low on gore, I would still only advise you to watch it if you are strong-hearted, as the atmosphere is quite harrowing."
Oh my God. How TERRIBLE can a movie get?,11 January 2008,7.0,"I saw this film in seventh grade. And liked it. i even brought myself to comparing it to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" at one point. How? i don't know. I thought of it in such a way i even showed it to one of my friends about two months later and told him it was better than Dawn of the Dead. For this i should be tarred and feathered. BUT, upon this second viewing, i started to notice things. Things that I didn't notice the first time. That viewing took me to a place i have only been to on two other occasions, but I won't get into that now. I'll just say that when the movie was over i had to apologize to my friend for lying and rethink this movie over and over.The first aspect of this movie i hated was the editing. Are we watching MTV or what? i beg one of you readers to count how long the longest shot in one of the escape scenes is. You won't touch 4 seconds. Maybe 3. Perhaps the tension would build a little bit if the camera relaxed and waited for a human being who is not on speed to catch up with it. At least that way we know what we're afraid of instead of picturing the 1/100 second flashes of the ""scary things"".The acting was atrocious and not in a charming horror movie way. The second leading man can't do a thing to cover up a British accent and Cary Elwes gave one of the worst performances in cinematic history. Why would the casting department hie a man who can't give a cry of pain to save himself from a real cry of pain. And Danny Glover? Does anything even need to be said? YES! What a bad role for even an ""only good in one movie(Tenenbaums)"" actor. We see know descent into madness. This is most likely because of the poor and pathetic writing or the sub-par performance given for a sub-par movie.Come to think of it, I can't think of one actor in this movie who I'd like to see in anything else unless they were playing a struggling and out of work actor. Ironic?Now for the development flaws. I'll start with the obvious one. how can it be that two healthy men can sit in a room for hours with a dead man WHO IS BREATHING? Do they expect us to buy that? An idiot maybe(Which isn't saying much for Saw fans). Not to mention that they spent a good amount of time near the beginning of the film focusing directly on ""the dead man"". Next, the killer's whole ""philosophy"" about how he doesn't actually kill people, he causes people to kill themselves. What? My metaphor is that if you put a landmine in the front yard of a day-care center and wait for recess, you didn't do anything wrong. It's the kid's fault they walked onto the landmine that you put there. Who honestly thinks this makes sense? Be honest. Also, this killer claims to give everyone a chance to get out of his traps. But Dr. Gordon has to kill Adam in order to get out and save his family. This gives Adam what kind of chance? On the tape, never does our killer mention a way for Adam to be saved. This goes against his whole philosophy. The flashback in which the girl is let free: There are numerous things that bother me about this sequence. For one, the principle that i applied to the Adam situation applies to the drugged stranger laying on the floor with his stomach cut open. Also, the cancer-ridden killer is somehow able to rig up a ""creepy"" doll to ride a tricycle and turn its head? That's just unrealistic for lack of a better word. Last but certainly not least, she later says that he helped her. Why? Because he got her off drugs? I know about drug-addicts and an experience like that would not want to make them do less drugs. And this helps her better than, say, rehab? Also, if this helping principle is applied to every case, how does it apply to Dr. Gordon and Adam's situation. Will killing a virtually innocent human being help a man with his infidelity problems? Cheating on your wife is not nearly as bad as killing a man. Apparently, I disagree with the killer. Too bad. What was Adam's wrong-doing in the first place?Why would a man who is just an orderly at a hospital who appears to be the killer at first, but soon is rectified take pleasure in tying up a mother and daughter at gunpoint? Not only does he do that, but he listens to the girls heartbeat as he points the gun at her mother's head. What was cause this guy to think that his killer is the only possessor of the antidote to his poison? I'd rather go for help hoping that the cure isn't Tridium. And even if the killer DID have the only antidote, how would a cancer-ridden old man obtain possession of such a rare substance. And it never thoroughly explains what Zep did to deserve such shabby treatment from the killer.Finally, The Twist. OOOHHH! How surprising! Why? Because we, as an audience don't expect a man whose living should have been apparent to our two main characters hours earlier. The movie all builds up to these two words.......Game Over! But not my review. No. How is the game over? We've left a still alive Adam, mother, daughter and Dr. Gordon unspoken for. OK, we can assume that the killer kills Dr. Gordon, but what about the rest of the characters? Once again, the movie leads up to ""Game Over"". Probably because this movie accomplishes about as much for the film industry as a bad Video Game that no one remembers. Wait, What's the difference?"
One of a Kind,28 April 2008,10.0,"Saw IS the best horror film and one of the best films i've seen in recent memory. It definitely claims it's place as being scary, sadistic, terrifying and utterly compelling. Everything exceeded beyond expectation and far beyond any horror film in the last 10 years. Saw is one of a kind, great and visceral, entertaining and horrific. It's impact will linger with you for years to come, and so it should. The brilliance and psychological effect both work brilliantly, as does the acting, directing and a totally original story.The detailed and initial depth of plot and character all work perfectly, as does with the twists and turns to keep you guessing till the end."
Let The Game Begin...,22 September 2011,10.0,"Oncologist Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and photographer Adam Faulkner-Stanheight (Leigh Whannell) wake up to find themselves chained to pipes in a derelict bathroom with no idea of how they got there; they are the latest victims of the serial killer known as Jigsaw, who carries out elaborate and sadistic 'games' in order to teach people to appreciate life.With six unnecessary sequels over the last seven years, I had forgotten just how original and innovative the first Saw film was; what a pleasant surprise then to find that, instead of struggling manfully through my first repeat viewing since 2004, the time whistled by, with the movie feeling as fresh, suspenseful and as twisted as it had the first time.When analysed, the plot is admittedly extremely far-fetched‚ÄîJigsaw's games, which rely on his victims doing precisely as predicted, could not possibly go off without a hitch‚Äîbut James Wan doesn't let that faze him and directs Leigh Whannell's convoluted script with enough style, energy and confidence to make it easy to turn a blind eye to the sheer preposterousness of proceedings. Although the film relies heavily on suggestion rather than outright gore, Wan still manages to make this a very unsettling experience, ensuring it as one to miss for the faint of heart but a gruesome treat for those who love their horror gritty and raw.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."
A Scary and Effective Thriller,12 February 2005,7.0,"Saw is one of the scariest movies of 2004 and its a must see for any horror fan. Two men wake up in a deserted basement chained to the pipes with a dead body between them, only to learn that they're trapped by a sadistic serial killer dubbed ""Jigsaw,"" to play a deadly game of kill or be killed. Apparently, this maniac has been doing this sort of thing for a awhile and he an obsessed detective (Danny Glover) is hot on his trail. The plot sounds very interesting and for the most part the film doesn't disappoint. The main actor in this film is Cary Elwes who plays Dr. Lawrence Gordon and plays his role effectively. Danny Glover plays the obsessed cop and also does very well. Monica Potter plays Dr. Lawrence Gordon's wife however she isn't in the film for very long. There are some truly horrifying scenes in Saw and one scenes that almost made me want to throw up. Saw is similar to Seven and even though it isn't as good its still worth a look. James Wan does a great job of directing and hopefully will have more opportunities to direct in the future. The ending is done very well and I didn't see all the twists and turns coming. However in the end you don't really care about the characters because they do bad things. I found it hard to have sympathy on some of them but that's just me. There are some stupid moments in the film though but not as many as the typical horror film. Rating 7/10 a very gruesome horror flick that's worth a look."
Make this film huge!,7 October 2004,7.0,"I went to watch this film last night not really expecting much as I haven't heard anything about it. The British press tend to groan about horror films. I was completely blown away at how amazing this film is! Not only is it genuinely frightening and scary, it is clever, original and down right amazing for a first times director and writer to come up with a concept like this. I never write reviews on films but was so impressed with this film I want it to get the recognition it deserves and the box office success too! This film is not for the faint hearted or weak stomached, but if you think you can brave it, then do. We all hear about the ""scariest horror film"" since the exorcist every year, but this really is. It's dark and twisted and is not your usual Happy Hollywood fare. I don't want to give anything away, but the scene in Adam's flat had the entire audience gasping and on the edge of their seats through pure fear! Go see SAW!"
A Truly Remarkable Movie!,21 September 2008,1.0,"Movies based on serial killers come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. But common to most of these movies is one central theme. The central character loves killing. He is a sadist and he is on the prowl. He defines his life by the amount of suffering he can impose on his victims. Many movies have been made on such ideas. What has perhaps differed from one movie to another is the method of killing. But in the end, the movies had a typical end - some way somebody manages to put a stop to all this. Some movie makers tried showing more blood and gore to attract the audience and some tried to show death in compromising situations which would attract the attention of the perverted. And after a significant amount of these movies came out a wonderful movie in form of Saw. The Saw movie is not like other movies at all. It is no doubt about a serial killer but this time the difference to the movie is not just the method of killing but also the motivation for doing so. The movie does not dwell too much on the past and development of the killer. That would be so typical, right? On one end, you show the current activity and parallel to this, show his past. No! This movie is not like that as well. It just shows his activities of the past but not his past. And then we come to know that this guy is completely different. He is not killing for pleasure and sadism like others, he is doing it as some kind of a perhaps misguided noble work. All his victims in the past have been drug addicts or people whom he thinks have no value for their own life.The movie takes you straight to the action. It has one of strangest beginnings I have ever seen and an end that is simply beyond imagination. And this makes the movie unique and special. The blood and gore wherever present is just right enough to produce the ideal effect on the minds of the viewer. The plot is good and the screenplay is very tight. The music is intense. The movie does not give you breathing time. It progresses rapidly and involves you completely. And should I say more about this movie, I would completely spoil the fun for you. Please avoid reading or knowing the story in advance else you will destroy all the fun for yourself. Cheers."
Classic original thriller,14 February 2021,1.0,"This movie is the first installment of an entire original series of movies that created its own genre. A combination of blood, gore, horror, and violence provides for great entertainment."
pipes,22 February 2005,10.0,"why did they try to cut the chains with the saw instead of trying to cut the pipes? .the pipes looked old and rusty - It would probably be easier...and don't forget the pipes are not made from steel.And why the doc didn't try to dislocate the smaller pipes on the wall? Is just not logic - they should of tried all the methods to brake free...the problem with this kind of movie (ex. Panic room, Blairwitch)is that you always have the impression that the heroes don't do everything they can to escape... is just frustrating"
One of the most disturbing films I've ever seen,28 February 2005,10.0,"A demonic serial killer (Okay, so he's not REALLY a serial killer, but¬Ö) imprisons two average men (Carey Elwes and Leigh Whannell) in a rather unpleasant bathroom in an ancient, long-deserted sewage plant. Things go from bad to worse for them when they realize that the intent of the said killer is for them to turn on one another and ultimately, kill one another. Wow. How can I describe a film like ""saw""? Brutal, disturbing, grisly, unpleasant¬Ö I think you get the picture. Elwes and Whannell (Who also scripted the film) both give excellent performances, but more importantly, we care about the characters, they're engaging and realistic, usually in this type of film I find myself not caring at all for the characters, that isn't so here, though. The characters are well-rounded and likable. I WANTED them to survive.This is James Wan's first big feature film, and he delivers everything here with extreme intensity, style, and atmosphere. The cinematography was superb and I loved the ways some of the flashbacks were filmed. The guy's got a great eye for detail and I'm sure we'll be hearing more from him soon. This is no Disney film, folks, in case you haven't guessed. Not only is it extremely gory at times, but the situations are so unsettling and mean-spirited that if the film hadn't been gory, it still would have earned every bit of it's R rating (come to think about it, this is probably the most physiologically disturbing film I've ever seen!). In my opinion, the ending was absolutely terrifying. I won't give it away, but it's easily the most twisted, ironic and anticlimactic ending I've ever seen. Yes, I'll admit, I did loose some sleep over it.""Saw"" is a flick that wasn't designed with the faint-of-heart in mind. It ruthless, brutal, and gruesome, but it's easily the most powerful and disturbing films I've ever seen.8/10."
One of James Wan's Best!,16 May 2021,8.0,"It Utilized its characters well. It uses torture porn to describe Humanity's selfishness, and selflessness in an ""Under the microscope fashion"". What you get is a mind bender, with good old fadhion scares to tell a unique story."
For the shock and fear factor there aren't many better,7 October 2018,8.0,"This is the first time since I set up my IMDb account that I'm struggling to decide on whether to give a film a positive or a negative rating. Despite having seen 'Saw' multiple times, the truth is that I still can't decide if I love it or hate it. Each time I watch it, I find myself thinking 'why am I watching this trash?', and yet it manages to keep me completely engrossed - and entertained - from beginning to end. It's one of those films that you struggle to enjoy in the moment, but once the credits roll you realise how good it was.Horror films are all about the shock and fear factor, and 'Saw' has that in abundance. The viewer is on edge throughout and the tension literally never lets up. 'Saw' probably goes as far as any horror film has done to satisfy horror fans. It ticks just about every box there is to tick, as well as a few others that didn't exist before 'Saw' came along. Whether you love it or hate it, or both as in my case, 'Saw' will always be a classic of the horror genre."
I want to play a game,24 July 2019,7.0,"Let me start with the negatives. This is a relatively low quality movie with a low budget. The actors are mostly horrible choices giving terrible performances and awful line delivery, especially the two leads and Danny Glover. And there are some questionable directing decisions and editing choices.Having said that, this is one of the coolest ideas for a movie. As someone who loves putting myself in the characters' shoes, this idea gives me the business. The story is awesome and intriguing as the mystery unfolds. So many memorable scenes and game ideas. It owned me the first time I watched it in theaters, even with the noobs laughing out loud at some of the acting. (about 6 viewings, 5/7/2021, 9/1/2023)SPOILERSI love how they explore the idea of Jigsaw helping his victims lead better lives if they survive the game. The twist at the end is one of the all-time greats and bumps the score up at least one star. And the music they play during the reveal is so perfect. Gives me goosebumps every time."
See saw.,31 October 2020,7.0,"Though its reputation has been sullied somewhat by its increasingly gruesome sequels, 'Saw (2004)' simply isn't the 'torture porn' many believe it to be. In fact, it's actually rather tame for what it is, preferring implication over overt gore, and is a much more cerebral experience than you may expect. It's an enigmatic, evolving thriller which focuses on a pair of men who find themselves chained up in a dirty bathroom with little more than a dead body between them. The picture is at its most successful when it's in this room, depicting its increasingly desperate characters coming to terms with their situation and trying to unravel its mystery before their time runs out. It isn't just confined to the one room, though; through flashback, it explores the lives of its central characters in the days leading to their current predicament. It also spends time with a pair of detectives trying to find the flick's antagonist, the elusive jigsaw killer. These segments mainly exist to fill in the gaps surrounding the killer's motives, which become increasingly obvious as the cops get closer to learning his true identity. The stuff outside the bathroom isn't bad, but it isn't as compelling and it's where the picture's ultra-low budget is most apparent (see its odd, almost disorienting car chase). The whole thing also has a grungy, early-2000s aesthetic that's more bemusing than scary and hasn't aged well. Luckily, the plot is relatively clever and layered, culminating in a constantly surprising finale that subverts expectation with each and every twist. The narrative is satisfying and engaging; it's what makes the experience as successful as it is. Of course, it is sometimes slightly laboured and it does get a bit silly now and again. However, it's an interesting and unexpected take on its genre that never fails to entertain. Overall, the movie is rather enjoyable. It isn't massively scary, but it has some fairly frightening ideas and edge-of-your-seat sequences. It also has an appropriately frustrating ending that provides little in the way of comfort. It's a solid horror-thriller that shouldn't be overlooked simply because of its sequels. 7/10"
"Acting has flaws, But an enjoyable movie.",9 March 2005,7.0,"From the first time I saw the trailer for this movie, I had no idea what it was about, but I thought that it would turn out good.The acting in this movie sometimes made me laugh, sometimes they just over did it and tried to do too much, not all of it was bad though. Danny Glover did'nt show up much in this movie, but he was deffinatley the best actor out of this movies' cast. The plot of the movie can keep you guessing up until the end, just about everything in this movie fits, except what I mentioned before, the acting had some flaws and some other things had few flaws. Overall this movie is a good seven out of ten."
"An awful film, for an awful audience",10 July 2005,1.0,"What is going on with people these days? How come this piece of celluloid junk can garner a 7.5 rating on IMDb, higher than films like ""The Duellists"", ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"", ""Predator""... or ""Bachelor Party"", for that matter? ""Saw"" is yet another derivative shocker, stealing copiously from the likes of ""The Cube"", ""Se7en"" and several low-budget European films. It has no redeeming values, and offers no real surprises to speak of. By comparison, ""Equilibrium"" was another derivative film, but it had a heart in the right place. ""Saw"" is pure cinematic drivel, coming from another ""cool"" wannabe director, probably weaned on video games and MTV-style editing, and scarred for life by hooded men in corridors with blinking yellow/blue lights.Beyond a bunch of shocking images, there's nothing worth a glance, much less a second look. We're not talking about a ""Funny Games"" type of movie here, since the German film was at least engaging, albeit in a sadistic way. The re-watchability factor is *zero* for James Wan's creation... I was wondering why the local Blockbuster stores are selling scores of ""Saw"" DVDs for a couple of bucks apiece. Now, that I've seen the film, I know the reason. Word of mouth may have helped this abomination gain some attention, but its real place remains the trash can, amidst empty syringes, vomit-stained underwear and junk food containers.I honestly wonder if the reviewers claiming this film teaches you true lessons in the meaning of life are in fact convicts escaped from an asylum where they were taught lessons about ""life, the Universe and everything"" - including art - by the likes of Dr. Mengele, Ceausescu and Uwe Boll."
Decent,14 March 2008,1.0,"Saw (2004) ** 1/2 (out of 4) The film opens in an abandoned bathroom where two men are chained to opposite sides of the room. Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell) don't remember how they got in this room but soon Gordon begins to fear this is the work of a serial killer the police have labeled ""The Jigsaw Killer"". This serial killer doesn't actually kill his victims but instead puts them in a life or death situation where in order to live, the victims must kill the other person or instead, kill themselves. Gordon and Adam have just under eight hours to figure a way out of this puzzle before their untimely death occurs.I remember reading a review of Wes Craven's Scream when it was first released and the reviewer, whose name I can't remember, mentioned that the opening scenes were so intense and it took no time to reach that high level of suspense. Within the opening minutes of Saw I felt the same way because, just like a fast car hitting zero to sixty miles per hours in a few seconds, this film takes off just as fast and is pretty relentless in its scenes of torture. However, the film with its wonderful start and finish is like two great pieces of bread without any fillings in the middle.There is so much to admire in this film that I only wish the middle sections were half as brilliant as the rest of the film. The opening scenes have a certain dirty and grungy look to them that sets the film up perfectly. The idea of a serial killer who forces someone to kill themselves is another interesting idea that goes all out. Unlike many other horror films, we've actually got smart people thinking out their situations and trying to come up with the best way to live. We've also got an incredibly haunting ending that has such a claustrophobic feel that I was automatically reminded of the dinner scene in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Another high aspect to the film are the performances by Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell who for most of the film are strapped to a pole. These two are the ones telling the story and it's up to them to get the viewers drawn into the story and make us want to care whether these men live or die. I was rather shocked at how much development was allowed in the screenplay for the Elwes character to really grow on us. Elwes has many emotional scenes in the film, especially towards the end when he begins to fear he may never see his wife and child again. The actual look of fear in his eyes is quite remarkable and I'd be curious to know how Elwes got himself to that level. Whannell is the more quiet of the two but he too makes for an interesting characters as does Danny Glover who plays a detective trying to track down the killer.I mentioned the middle section of the film really doesn't work and I think it's mainly due to the fact that the intensity level from the start, once it hits the sixty miles per hour, slams into a brick wall and stops the film cold in its tracks. We get to see some of the serial killers previous victims but this really doesn't add too much to the story when we're supposed to be concentrating on the two men in the bathroom. The side story dealing with Elwes personal life isn't too interesting either but I guess this was somewhat needed in order for the viewing to understand why he was selected to play this game. I think the film would have been better off without all the back story and instead focused on the two men trapped in this game. I personally feel their acting was strong enough that it could have carried the film a lot further than any of the flashbacks did.Having said that, the film hits full stride again towards the end with a finale that is downright shocking. I'm not going to give anything away but I wouldn't mind comparing the ending to this as being just as shocking as the ending to Psycho forty-four years earlier.Not only does the shock ending work but so does the climax to our two characters fate.Again, the feel of dread, torture and pain are so agonizing that I'd rank this higher than what was seen and felt in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The film certainly isn't for the faint of heart and I'm sure those with prejudice attitudes towards horror films will be left sickened but hey, that's the point. Saw gets a marginal recommendation due to the wonderful start, ending and performance by Elwes."
"As far as recent horror movies go, Saw can definitely be the best!",21 November 2009,9.0,"After all those half-assed horror movies like Boogeyman, it was time a movie like Saw came and scared us, not physically, but mentally. The sequels that came afterwards aren't entirely as good as this movie, but then again not much can be compared to this movie, which will probably go down in history as a cult horror film, the next never-ending horror franchise in the style of ''Friday the 13th'' or ''Halloween'', without all the slashing action. Saw doesn't scare us with all the gruesome murders (at least not the first one), but it's the psychological aspect of the plot that kept me into the film. In fact all, movie long I was wondering what the hell was going to happen to the two main characters, Adam and Lawrence.In fact the story focuses on two characters: Adam and Lawrence Gordon, two men who wake up chained in a bathroom. They are told to kill one another before 6 O'clock PM or their families will die. Meanwhile, Detective Tapp and his accomplice Sing try to get as much info on the Jigsaw killer by talking to Amanda, a survivor from one of his sadistic ''tests''. Visually speaking, the movie isn't all that great, the visual effects aren't super but for it's 1.2 million budget, it's got some pretty decent effects. The acting is okay, some are very good and some are very bad, the acting is never equivalent. So why am I giving it a 10??? Simply because the script is so well-crafted. The story is so awesome, it's twisted. You think something will happen when it's actually something else. You can never guess, and thus, even after you've seen it many many times. Also, the story affects your psychology directly. The two men socialize in a way that you want to know what will happen in the end. If you want a beautifully crafted, twisted thriller who isn't for the squeamish, then Saw is the closest to perfection you will ever get."
"The first, the best!",14 January 2021,9.0,"Okay, i have seen a lot of horror films. Saw was another one that i liked much. Saw 2,3,4...and so on were movies i disliked. The splatter was increasing for no apparent reason, the atmosphere and the whole set up and the feeling, that made the first a success, were all missing from the rest. I liked the flow of the movie. And then the movie ended. And i found my jaw fallen on the floor. Incredible movie. No i wont spoil you anything!!! Go and watch it!"
Game changer,26 July 2021,10.0,"James Wan is the best horror director of this century, very good Horror/Thriller with a vibe from Se7en. Highly recommended."
Stomach turning of really high quality,27 March 2005,10.0,"Seven-wannabe they say. To begin with, ""Seven"" is rather overestimated and mostly a favorite among the chic film watchers. ""Saw"" is much more than a conventional horror movie and much more than ""Seven"".The agony is for real. This claustrophobia hurts and it's hard to alienate yourself from it. This is a chamber play. It's interesting to follow what goes on between the men who are trapped in the bathroom. Both have had complicated lives before they got there. And you are really surprised at the end. When did that last happened in a horror movie? Has it ever occurred? Not what you can remember of.Great job by director James Wan. Unfortunately there will be a ""Saw 2"". Can he manage that risk?"
Quality thrills,10 March 2009,7.0,"Let me start by saying I for some reason had never really had any inclination to see this movie, for some reason it did not appeal to me. Well anyway I found myself watching the movie on a holiday I have just returned from and let me say I was pleasantly surprised (and pleasant it a word I would imagine you will not find associated with this movie very often). Where this movie works is in its simple premise. Cheaply made with a small set but this actually aides the suspense built up as the main characters slowly interact with one another revealing more about themselves. This is interspersed with reveals to Jigsaw the orchestrator of the two protagonist's fates. The movie moves along at a good pace introducing us to Jigsaws previous crimes as well as the police officers on his trail with a increasing sense pf dread and the payoff is worth it (as much as these things can be) with a very satisfactory ending. Yes there are some horrific moments but nowhere near as many as I expected and I believe the movie is better for this. A must for horror fans, and others with a strong constitution."
Very good horror film!,14 September 2006,7.0,"Before ""Saw"" premiered at Sundance festival in January 2004, few could have imagined that this new horror film would be part of a new wave of horror films that brought back gore and violence to the screens and moved away from the now formulaic style of self-referential teen slashers started with Wes Craven's ""Scream"" back in 1996. To call ""Saw"" revolutionary would be an exaggeration, but it's fair to point out that it was among the very the first of this resurgence that received wide public acclaim and became popular in mainstream crowds, proving that an R-rated horror film still can achieve financial success.""Saw"" begins with two men waking up in an old, and apparently abandoned industrial washroom. They don't know each other, and apparently the only thing they have in common is that they are both chained to the pipes with only a small saw as a tool, not enough to cut the chain, but good enough to cut their feet. Trapped in this nightmarish scenario, the men try to figure out an escape to their situation, and get to know each other; one is a young photographer named Adam (Leigh Whannell) and the other is a surgeon named Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes). Lawrence realizes they have been kidnapped by the notorious serial killer named ""Jigsaw"", a man who puts their victims in deadly situations that most of the times lead to their deaths.Written by Leigh Whannell and director James Wan, ""Saw"" gives a new edge to the serial killer stories turning what otherwise would be another thriller into a full-fledged horror movie. The premise of the film is quite original, and via flashbacks we discover the past of both Gordon and Adam, as well as the story of this killer named Jigsaw, whose identity is a mystery and seems to be destined to be the bogeyman of this decade. Full of plot twists and with a cleverly hidden secret, the film keeps the mystery until the end, making an enjoyable and for the most part rewarding thriller.But as written above, ""Saw"" goes beyond the common conception of ""thriller"" and adds a horror edge closer to 70s grind-house than to otherwise similar films like ""Seven"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"". Director James Wan focuses on the graphic violence of Jigsaw deathtraps and makes ""Saw"" a visually different kind of film, delivering a very good mix of detective story and gory horror film. However, Wan can't escape the influence of music videos and the now-clich√©d use of shaky camera and rapid cuts. At times the overuse of this device breaks the suspenseful pace of the film in sadly awful ways.The acting is for the most part effective, without nothing really spectacular, although good considering the budget. Leigh Whannell delivers a good performance and while Elwes' accent at time slips out, he is a nice counterpart for Whannell's character. Danny Glover and Ken Leung appear in supporting roles, as the cops following Jigsaw's case. the two have great chemistry together, but it's safe to say Leung steals most of the scenes they share.""Saw"" suffers a lot from the extensive overuse of that music video style described above. Together with the metal soundtrack completely break the atmosphere of the story and look strange and out of place (as the characters are far from teenagers). The flashbacks are for the most part a well used device, although they too tend to break the momentum from time to time. Most critics have labeled the script of ""unbelievable"" and numerate the many plot holes the film has, and while they are right in many ways, ""Saw"" manages to work fine with all those plot holes because in the end, the core story is well-handled.In some way, ""Saw"" came up as a wake up call for the horror genre, in many ways superior to previous attempts to revive the genre like ""Cabin Fever"", but still far from perfect. Still, it's safe to say that James Wan and Leigh Whannell have crafted a nice and original new entry in the genre and may represent a new source of thrills in the future. While maybe not a classic yet, ""Saw"" is a very recommended films for fans and non-fans of the horror genre. 7/10"
I screamed out loud,6 November 2004,10.0,"I didn't want to see this. I had seen no previews...The Incredibles was sold out. Although I came out cursing the film, I would recommend it to anyone that has emptied their bladder and has someone close by to grab for comfort.For serious moviegoers, imagine the movie Seven, in quicktime. I was worried that the whole movie would play entirely in the dingy room...much as Phonebooth did, but the plot progressed with flashbacks and the like.The trapped Adam and Dr. Gordon work with the clues given. As they discover the clues, you can predict what is going to happen, which gives the viewer a feeling of involvement. However, it leaves you with enough suspense that you can't predict everything, especially the ending.I, and the entire movie theater, screamed out loud at one part. I also yelled a rated R word without meaning to. My roommate and I held hands since her boyfriend was no comfort. I didn't even recognize Cary Elwes until he began to talk. He has changed a lot since Princess Bride. While I consider him to be a decent actor, he didn't suit this film. He held well until the end, but his last words left me screaming 'fake.'This film is very well made - the plot was fantastic. But warning, the acting belongs to an '80s slasher film. Danny Glover played the cop role, but the movie is not a resume booster for him. Again, while an exciting thriller, this is definitely not Oscar material. Glover deserves better.Leave the children at home."
James Wan proves that a horror movie has nothing to do with a high budget..,5 January 2013,10.0,"Slasher of 1990's included Scream franchise,I know what you did last summer,Halloween:20 years later,Urban legend and some other stuffs like that....These all were good but were not these all same.A killer running behind a girl,and then he slips and the victim thinks she's safe but the killer brutally murders her.But here is an another one-SAW.What above mentioned flicks failed to deliver was a true horror which left the viewers dumbfounded.Saw is gory and bloody but it's great.Here the killer does not run but sees people,enjoying their death and happy for those you survive.Saw has everything that a gory and bloody movie needs.If you like grey matter,blood and other stuffs like that flowing around,you will definitely enjoy this one.I found it quite amazing and if you don't take it as a slasher it's gonna rock....my review-8.3"
"I see his point, i see her point i see all the damn points",31 March 2005,7.0,"Well lets start off with how the movie was....before people analyze anything you watch it for the storyline. Great ending, id have to say i missed points when i saw it was John as Jigsaw, but again i focused on the story. After seeing it one time id say the ending made the movie, 4 of 5 stars, then watching it two times i saw the acting, that Adam guy wasn't too great and also Lawrence, i was laughing at one point on Lawrences acting skills, all the other acting was good though, i give it 3 of 5 stars for acting..now the big hub bub, ""i saw johns hand move"", ""why couldn't he use his shirt"", ""the phone was easily reachable""...people the director cant fix every single one of the flaws it was his FIRST movie debut and id have to say it was damn good for a 1st one, i see everyones points in the flaws but again wouldn't it suck if Dr. Gordon chained up two shirts instead of cutting his leg off, people wouldn't think its too great of a flick! DUH, the story was the ONLY WAY OUT WAS TO CUT OFF HIS LEG...AKA SAW, and yes I'm sure its called saw because of Jig ""saw"" but still, they need blood to be shed instead of the use of intellect, hello this was a horror-suspense not McGuyver! So thus all you critics need to stop thinking so hard, and go analyze bond movies LOL"
A new Beginning for Crime and torture.,1 February 2009,7.0,"At first I didn't have faith for this movie mainly because it generated many speculation towards a new way of horror film making in the new millennium. I let some time pass and finally decided to give it a chance... my mistake I didn't watch it before.Saw is an excellent Crime/Horror movie with some interesting bits of sci-fi and even giallo. I think about Jigsaw, the movie's villain as a crazy preacher that is angry with anyone that isn't taking the best about happiness. Now this is a clever villain because he doesn't murder his victims; he puts them some mortal tramps and plays with them psychologically in order for them to commit suicide.The character development is really interesting and you get to know them perfectly. Also, the situations surrounded by them are extremely interesting because psychologically they change as some nasty situations happen.The direction is spectacular and I dug the editing. This is a movie to praise and consider it as a new way of horror film making. The soundtrack is just spectacular and I always praise the Hello Zepp theme. Wonderful mix of everything. Danny Glover ruled the screen but the main characters also deliver expectations.A dark, morbid, and gory movie that should deliver expectations for any Horror lovers."
The best horror movie ever...,22 April 2007,9.0,"So first off, what is all there is to know about ""Saw""? Well, firstly, it's a horror movie from the mind of Director James Wan. It is one of the best known movies in the Horror genre to date. It stars some big names like Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Shawnee Smith, Monica Potter, and Dina Meyer. Before this there was a 10 minute short with the same name, this time Leigh Whannell as the reverse bear trap victim. It also has 2 popular sequels.There's loads more to know, but that's not really important right now. As much as I am honored to parade ""Saw"" as my all-time favorite movie, I am also honored to parade it as the Best Horror Movie I've ever seen, as the title explains.The film begins with a man named Adam (Leigh Whannell) asleep in a bathtub while a light is floating around his head and the water is draining. The light goes down the drain, and he wakes up. He finds out that he is in a bathroom, but it's too dark with the lights off. As soon as he gets out of the bathtub, he finds out that his leg is chained to a pipe. He yells and screams and a low voice responds. When the lights turn on, there is another man, his leg is also chained to a pipe. His name is Gordon, and he is a doctor. There is a dead body in a pool of blood in the middle of the floor, with a tape recorder and gun in his hands. They grab the tape recorder, and they each find out about the fact that they each have a tape.They play the tapes, and based on one of them, Gordon's test is to kill Adam to save his family. His family has been trapped. There is a limit as to when he has to kill Adam, which is 6:00. Along the way, we learn about someone named Amanda, who's a junkie. We learn that she was tested too. The test? She wakes up with a strange device around her head. A video comes on, with a creepy puppet. The puppet is based on a serial killer named Jigsaw, and he created the puppet. The puppet tells Amanda that she must find the key in the body of her ""Dead"" cell mate. If she dosen't, her jaw is permanently ripped open. She cuts open the stomach of the cell mate, and sifts through the organs and locates the key in his heart. She successfully takes the trap off and the puppet comes out, congratulating her.""Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you, not anymore."" Meanwhile, we discover about other people, including detectives who enter Jiggy's lair, and many other traps.Saw is a truly great masterpiece. Great blood s/fx, and great plot line with a twist that you don't see coming.So If you like horror films, this is a must see."
"Mix in some way cool kills, clever plot turns, and horrendous acting and you get ""Saw""",7 March 2005,9.0,"Saw is a kick your ass kind of a movie. The kills are shown in full detail and each one is so creative and frightening. I also must give props to the writers for inventing perhaps the most terrifying contraption I have ever seen. Yes, I am talking of the reverse bear trap. The movie begins with two complete strangers who get one hell of a wake up call. They are trapped in a bathroom without any recollection of how they got there. The plot is similar to ""Seven"" with a serial killer choosing his victims for their sins of not appreciating life. Lets just say insanity and scary as hell puppet clown dolls ensue. The only rusty edge that Saw possesses is the TERRIBLE acting. There's a major plot turn in which a main character goes insane and it's handled so ridiculously that I ended up laughing instead of feeling the intended pity and horror. But aside from the acting Saw is one hell of a ride.7/10"
fearlessly downbeat thriller,7 April 2005,7.0,"SPOILERS! ""Saw"" is something of a testament to the power of genre films, a marker of how low-down, gritty, and generally unpleasant a plot can be, while being mercilessly intense and suspenseful at the same time. It also is a testament to why most film critics simply aren't cut out to critique such films--in an era of feigned PC cuddliness and romantic comedies with Brittany Murphy, it's downright MEAN to splatter our fine multiplexes with the type of morbid bloodshed found in ""Saw."" Shame on you, Mr. Wan and Whannell! Have you no courtesy for the real-life suffering of human beings?! Perhaps that's the point said critics are so slow to acknowledge. Downbeat, gut-wrenching, and intricately crafted, ""Saw"" is pure escapism that takes us to a dark place that we never hope to visit in reality. The plot begins deviously simple--two men awaken in a disgusting, decaying bathroom with their legs shackled--and becomes increasingly complicated as the film progresses. In the vein of a true thriller (however B-list), director James Wan (working from costar Leigh Whannell's script) has a knack for keeping plot details hidden in order to build suspense, so that their inclusion later on will make sense (poor Zepp!). The grungy visual style is an obvious nod to David Fincher (the atmosphere and plot is pure ""Seven""), and the plot--which could be taken from any one of a million serial killer pics--actually forgoes the POV of the murderer and instead focuses on the two characters (Cary Elwes and Whannell) trapped in the room.I have viewed ""Saw"" several times, and must say the quality of the acting improves each time. Whereas I found Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, and Monica Potter (okay, not much of a stretch there) to be hamming it up to an insufferable degree the first time out, I have lumped this eccentricity in as a contributing factor to ""Saw""'s morbid charm. Though at times overwrought, Elwes's performance seems to accurately reflect the neuroses of an average man put in an unfamiliar, oppressive situation--there is even a note of horrifying tragedy in the decision he winds up making. He and Whannell are an unusual couple, but their interactions have a certain grace and are not dull. Michael Emerson, who plays the patsy Zepp, is probably the film's standout--a performance that depends heavily on nuance to trick the audience into seeing him as a cold-blooded killer and, ultimately, a pawn. Tobin Bell, a character actor who has spent his career playing lowlifes and killers, phones in his minor role as the murderer Jigsaw.Though drowned in a sea of hype months before it hit theaters, ""Saw"" is a solid reminder that true horror and suspense is still alive and kicking, even if it is only with one foot..."
The Most Undeserved 7.5 in the History of IMDb,25 April 2005,7.0,"This movie had a good premise, but, simply put, poor acting and poor direction/cinematography ruin this flick.Actually poor acting would be complement. Honestly, this is has some of the worst acting performances I've seen in recent memory. If you want to see the definition of overacting watch Cary Elwes in the last 15 minutes of this movie. Ughhhhhhhhh.The fact that this movie received a 7.5 from IMDb voters is an indictment of the whole IMDb rating system. Its not like only 50 people gave it this high of ranking. 16,000 people have voted for this. That fact alone makes me lose faith in mankind. Please don't see this. You will make James Wan think he is actually a competent director. An utter waste of time and money. I want my 100 minutes and 4 bucks back.I know this review sounds pretentious, but I'm not trying to be. The movie is actually this bad. I'm trying to make all your lives better. Everything I say is the truth. If you have a brain in your head you will heed my advice. 1 out of 10."
"Jaw-dropping, bloody, shocking, great horror fun!",16 October 2006,8.0,"OMG! This was a genius of a horror movie: bloody, shocking, and jaw-dropping...everything a horror movie is suppose to be about! Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannel, who is also the co-writer of the film) are two men who have never met before and both wake up chained on opposite ends of an abandoned bathroom with a corpse in the middle of the floor holding a gun and a tape recorder. Each find an envelope with a tape, but Dr. Gordon's envelope also comes with a bullet. They play their tapes and find themselves at the hands of a serial killer called the ""Jigsaw killer"" who sets them up to play a game in which Lawrence is to kill Adam by six o'clock or his family will die. As the two men struggle to understand the situation they are in the serial killer is somewhere watching. What is so frightening about this film is that the serial killer doesn't technically kill his victims, but instead finds ways for his victims to kill themselves or each other. The situations are grisly and gruesome and emotionally raw. The Jigsaw killer targets victims who are not grateful for living or self-destructive in some way. Be prepared to watch this film and be even more prepared for the ending that is only seen in the most terrifying of all horror films."
The Golden Age of Saw!!!,24 October 2009,10.0,"This is where the games began, and started an entire franchise of Saw films. Before there was Hoffman, Strahm, Jill, and Erickson, it was just Jigsaw testing Adam and Dr. Lawrence Gordon in an old dirty and filthy bathroom with a dead body in the middle. They hear a tape by Jigsaw that tells Dr. Gordon to kill Adam by 6:00 a.m., or his wife and daughter will die. Zep has his family hostage and Detecive David Tapp still thinks that Dr. Gordon is linked to the Jigsaw murders. Throughout the time in the room, we see flashbacks of Jigsaw's other games, and why Adam and Gordon are in the room. If you love horror, and twists, you'll love SAW!!!"
Should've stopped at one,12 March 2019,10.0,"Saw is a perfect example of a movie that should have been standalone, because the sequels really ruin all the mystery and atmosphere established in this film. Saw works great as a horror/crime drama with an intriguing plot and twist that while convoluted and requires a bit of suspension of disbelief is still shocking and effective."
"Torture porn? Well, not exactly...:(",7 February 2020,7.0,"Saw (2004) is one of those movies infamous for it's bloody violent and gory theme. Sometimes often referred to as 'torture'. Well, it indeed it is, but not exactly.So, most of you must have known the plot by now. So, I'll tell in short. Two strangers woke up in a toilet, who later find themselves as the part of a deadly game by a psycho named 'Jigsaw' who is actually a very clever. He didn't directly kills his victims but sets deadly traps instead. His philosophy is simple, those who don't value life, either of themselves or others, must be taught a lesson. Now the movie is low budget so some cheap computer effects can be ignored (especially that car chase scene). Otherwise, the cinematography is watchable. Acting is good too. But Idk why i felt somewhat bland after watching it. Maybe I expected more violence and gore or maybe the critics had created way too much hype. Nevertheless, it isn't torture but indeed, is disgusting and disturbing. And pls don't call it a horror movie."
The best thriller ever made.,9 September 2008,7.0,"I'm a huge fan of the horror and action genres, and I've seen most all of what both have to offer. Though sometimes I'd find a movie that was great, I've never once seen anything like Saw. It created its own sub-genre and it turned every clich√© I've ever known on its end. Saw is one of the only perfect movies I've ever seen.The reason Saw is original is because it takes everything you've known about standard storytelling rules and completely ignores every one. The villain is the only ""good guy"" you're going to see and the ""good guys"" are the only ""bad guys"" you're going to see. From that basic stance alone, I cannot name another movie like Saw. I know works of literature like A Clockwork Orange try to make bad seem good, but it's done is such a traditional way it is ridiculously predictable and nothing really that hasn't been done before. But Saw is so simple in how it twists the rules of storytelling that it is blatantly obvious and punk. The literary geeks hate this movie because it does something they said could never be done: it breaks the rules they said every story had to abide by. The critics hate this movie because it isn't a safe clich√© that they have known all their lives like No Country for Old Men. The standard horror enthusiast hates this movie because it breaks every rule of a traditional horror plot ever conceived. And unlike the supposed ""deep moral"" movies like Battle Royale, Saw actually has moral point that you can use and a moral that isn't a redundant clich√©.As far as gore goes, it's enough to hold me over but isn't really excessive or as insane as the other movie in the series. But I think what make this an effective movie is there is no cheese like in the old slashers. This is something that could happen, and it's portrayed that way. Also, unlike every other movie like it, Saw is not only twisted but gory as well. It's almost an unspoken rule in cinema that if your movie is twisted/disturbing then you cannot show gore. I'm referring to movies like Sev7n and The Silence of the Lambs¬ótwisted, but no gore on screen. Once again, Saw breaks another rule.But what really sells Saw is the stylish punk style. With the flash-cuts, the lighting-paced editing, the blood on screen at almost all points in the movie¬óthis was made for the ADD generation. I'll never understand why traditionalists¬óeven those who don't want to admit they're traditionalists¬óthink there has to be at least 20 minutes of pure boredom every other scene for a movie to be good. Saw is a true thriller¬óit doesn't give you a second to sit there and be bored into a comfort zone.The ending plot twist is the single best plot twist of all time. I've seen a lot of plot twists, and while most of them go down the bland physiological path, or the clich√© you-thought-I-was-a-good-guy-but-I'm-the-killer! stance, Saw once again uses its own plot to do a plot twist like none I've ever seen. The entire movie is deceptive, and you literally know nothing until the last 5 minutes.I simply cannot think of a single thing wrong with Saw. I tried, but I can't. It's the most perfect thriller ever made, and one of the most original movies of the modern generation.10/10"
Best in the series,8 July 2019,8.0,"This film is probably the most serious of the series but still the best. I had fun with all the Saw movies, but while the others are just viewed for the gruesome, this one actually has decent writing and a good plot. Yes, characters are very stereotypical horror movie people, but that doesn't take away the enjoyment and fun of this film."
"""SHARP"", But Not Quite Sharp Enough",4 March 2006,8.0,"Poor Wesley. For Cary Elwes, former beloved of THE PRINCESS BRIDE, this is about as far away from the beautiful, fairy-tale perfection of the fields of Florin as you can get. Now, he's Doctor Lawrence Gordon, barefoot and chained in the most hellishly nasty abandoned washroom you could possibly imagine, just like his fellow captive, Adam, (SAW'S author, Leigh Whannell.) They are both the latest victims of the dementedly brilliant serial killer, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell from THE X-FILES, amongst other things), who actually never kills any of his victims...he gets them to kill themselves, or each other, depending on what sick rules he's set for the twisted games he plays.SAW did gangbusters at the box office, and has many admirers...amongst those who probably haven't seen a lot of movies of its kind. But what Whannell and director James Wan have actually done is steal from the best, which is what most great filmmakers do. The biggest problem with doing it, is that when you do ""borrow"" certain plot conventions, you have to do it in a way that one-ups the great sources you're stealing from. And since SAW cribs from SE7EN, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, AND THEN THERE WERE NONE and the cult classic THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES, it has already shot itself in the foot...so to speak, before it even gets started.Plus, in spite of some great photography, truly disturbing images and some well done moments of outright creepiness, you can't quite shake the feeling that Whannell and Wan were feeling a little too pleased with their own cleverness as they made it. The ""cherry"" on top is one honey of a shocker ending, which unfortunately places it in BLAIR WITCH territory, as a film whose first 85 or so minutes just aren't as good as the last five.I wasn't as P.O.'ed by the end as I was with HIGH TENSION. Not a bad first effort, but the script could've definitely benefited from some more tweaking. And it might've helped if it had been an entirely unknown cast, instead of having the perfunctory low-budget ""guest appearances"" (THE SHIELD'S Benito Martinez, STARSHIP TROOPERS' Dina Meyer, ALONG CAME A SPIDER'S Monica Potter, and most wasted of all, Danny Glover.) Good if you have never seen a serial killer/psycho-thriller before. But any one of the other films I mentioned will probably seem MUCH better than the first time, if you watch them right after seeing SAW."
Pure horror,22 November 2005,7.0,"It's been a long while since I was this scared while watching a movie and I have to say it felt great! I was never a fan of slasher movies, they always seemed to deliver (and still do) such cheap and short thrills it felt a waste of unexplored potential. Now ""Saw"" comes along, maybe the most thrilling, disturbing, horrific and fresh movie of the year, (plus immense kudos for making it on such an outstandingly small budget), and proves my previously mentioned point perfectly. Either way, I'll repeat it again-slasher movies are for pus.ies! Everything in this movie surprised me, and every surprise was more than welcome. Like the dreadful Jigsaw's mind ""Saw"" feels prepared in advance and knows exactly what it has to do. Set the trap, pick a victim (us, the audience), and leave everything else into our hands. I was genuinely petrified in every 'trap' scene, some work just because of great imagination and the main one because of the story and acting. I probably wouldn't have recognized Cary Elwes in his role, and somehow a combination of low budget meets known celebrity faces works really well. I will give you no gory details, you should go see this movie with absolutely no information whatsoever-just step into a world of senseless sense. I couldn't help but admire the crazy Jugsaw man, as sick and banal it may seem, but his character makes a lot of sense. Which, in the end, when we are let to put together all the pieces of the puzzle, makes this movie more than worth your while.Perversely enjoyable, incredibly well paced and thought out, impressively acted(and I'm talking especially about Cary Elwes's character in the end) and directed with a fresh new approach and interesting cinematography, ""Saw"" is a pure cult classic. You will not forget about it, you will only appreciate it-just like Jugsaw wanted you to;)Can't wait to see the next installment!9/10 - Recommendations: Anyone who's looking for much more than a cheap thrill"
"I loved it (mild trailers, nothing specific)",11 October 2004,7.0,"I saw the trailers, It looked good...I was pretty excited about seeing it. I must say I was very pleased. I don't know why so many people found fault in the acting. I just didn't see it. Maybe I didn't notice because I was to wrapped up trying to figure it out along with the victims. This movie kept my attention. In the beginning I was afraid I would be disappointed. It seemed to move kind of slow for me...more mystery...less actual horror......once we got onto the second half tho and the doctor started loosing his composure...YES!!! now thats what I want to see...hysteria, panic, realization of whats really going on, despair, all of it..and I got what I wanted thats for sure. I am one of those people ALWAYS trying to figure out the ending before it arrives...I thought I had it...I don't get fooled often...this movie got me and that made me love it even more. I was pleased as things unraveled as hero's annoy me. I wanted a clever ending that wasn't a storybook close,not and they all live happily ever after. Certainly wont find that here. Not so gory that I couldn't watch....but left plenty of scenes where I had to grit my teeth and hold my breathe...especially when you see that the dr. is coming to the realization that he is definitely going to use that saw for the purpose it was intended.I was like...omg I think he's gonna do it....GREAT STUFF!!"
The start of a long running franchise,27 October 2009,10.0,"I was first intrigued by the trailer of this film is why I chose to watch it despite the positive reception it was getting when it first came out. The scenario of a serial killer who plays a game of life and death without getting his hands dirty was amusing and actually quite original. The serial killer got the reputation of being called Jigsaw cause he makes the victims go through a game where blood shed is needed to survive, he is obsessed with teaching his victims the value of life, in a deranged and sadistic way after abducting them. So basically he tries to test the fabric of human nature. The main victims of this game is Adam Faulkner-Stanheight(Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon(Cary Elwes), they have to face different choices in order to survive and depending on the choice, it will decide if one or both of them will survive. This was a good and entertaining horror thriller, that is well worth the audiences time, mainly cause of the creativity and a cool twist that happens near the end. The acting in this movie is not very good, especially Cary Elwes. I think he is better off doing comedies like ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" cause his acting is actually quite funny during serious scenes. And while the victims are trying to solve Jigsaw's puzzle, it goes back and forth with a cop played by Danny Glover who is obsessed with tracking Jigsaw down. Despite the films low budget, it will keep the audience intrigued and will keep them guessing, it is a suspenseful film that has thrills and chills. Worth checking out if you want to see some originality in horror, just not that good the second time around cause most saw movies are known for flash backs with a twist, but this is a good start.7.5/10"
"Bloody,Gory,Awesome,Disturbing...",31 December 2005,10.0,"The list goes on and on. Saw is one of the goriest movies I've ever seen. And I've seen my fair share (Saving Private Ryan,The Passion Of The Christ,Saw II). I knew there would be twists at the ending-and I'm not just talking about the ""corpse"" in the middle of the bathroom-the one twist that really got me was that Zep himself was a pawn. The twist that really got me was the one with Tapp and the pics-I thought to myself ""What the f---?"". Another twist that stuns me was that Gordon actually cut off his freakin foot! Anyway, this is a really great movie. It really makes you value your own life a lot, at least a little more. If this was based on a true story, I would sit up and think about this sadistic bastard late at night. I saw this before Saw II, but I wouldn't miss either."
um..... wow,23 November 2005,7.0,"The concept is pretty sadistic. two men are chained on opposite sides of a filthy room. they both have to play the game of a sadistic serial killer who ""teaches"" the value of life through his murders. One of the two men,Lawrence, has to kill the other, Adam. Adam could kill Lawrence first, but neither of them can accomplish this without first sawing off the ankle of which their chains hold them.When i heard about this movie, i thought to myself ""Okay this movie is just an excuse to show sadistic, brutal and disturbing murders"". That might be true, but the story as a whole is quite interesting. before i continue, i'll come right out and say that most of the plot developments and concepts in this movie are either highly unlikely, or flat out bull s***.this movie cares about the two men whoa re chained up. there is plenty of explanation of their lives, and we learn about the motives of two detectives as well. as a result, we the audience find ourselves caring deeply about them. I'm talking about the kind of ""caring"" feeling where you're begging the movie not to kill off your favorite character, although it's most likely going to happen.The twists are, for the most part, unpredictable.The acting is great. this is of course my opinion, but I couldn't see how some critics could bash the actors for not doing their job. Cary Elwes was fantastic. Danny glover was good, as he usually is. in fact I don't think i can say a negative thing about any of the cast.Now, again, the plot concepts and developments are highly unlikely or flat out bull s***. But you may find yourself letting it go because this crap is just so interesting.***/****"
terrifying,19 March 2005,7.0,"What is certainly peculiar here is the mechanism of telling facts. The viewer, at least is what I felt, finds himself trapped in watching this deadly competition; the director reveals clues, surprises and deliciously twisted moments. The general feeling is of something rather revolting, coz some nauseating scenes give a very strong visceral impact; on the whole I would say that its stronger point is the originality. Not a serial killer movie, but a game created for these unlucky victims on a basis impossible to predict for the audience. Apart from Danny Glover and Monica Potter, other actors are quite unknown but they didn't play so bad."
"If you like Se7en, then you will like Saw.",8 November 2004,8.0,"I liked this movie. I enjoyed the story, acting, and the suspense. This movie is like Se7en, because its about a psycho who chooses people that are involved in one vice or another and tricks them into killing themselves or others; leaving them messed up for life and maybe better off dead. The main gripe I have about the movie is the Killer's reasons for choosing his victims was pretty weak. But, this lack of a decent reason for the complicated design for madness the Killer put his victims through, also made the killer more interesting, mysterious, increased the belief that any average ordinary person could be next. I was surprised about the ending. It is the reason why this movie got a 7 instead of a 6. I went to see this movie hoping to be disturbed. I didn't get disturbed, but I was entertained. Saw should be seen at least once by all (except children)."
Absurd Plot,27 March 2005,8.0,"Okay, the set-up is really great, with a really horrifying predicament to the two ""heroes."" And the previous, devious evils of the Jogsaw Man are frightening, as well. But, really, can anyone understand the ending? The supposed brain-dead character (who appears for a split second in the film) winds up the killer! Please...there is no sense to it. And the actions of Danny Glover's character? No way. Come on. Films can be more intelligently written than this one. There are plot twists that occur out of thin air. This is decidedly not a thinking man's horror film. (Okay, the directing and film-making are decent.) Sorry, this film started with high expectations laid out but falls far short of excellence."
Mortifyingly Claustrophobic Splatter Film,6 November 2008,7.0,"When I first saw this ideal sleeper hit, I was absolutely terrified. It wasn't that it was violent or Gothic. Rather, it was that it is claustrophobic even when the story reaches beyond its main setting, an unsavory dungeon warehouse bathroom. Saw never comes up for a breath of pleasant fresh air, even by the mortifying end, an end that will make even the most adventurous or free-flowing of viewers become at least scared of the dark. This was the most scared I had ever been by a movie from the horror genre. I loved it for its nonstop bearhug of creepiness.The film opens as Adam wakes up in a bathtub full of water, getting out of the bathtub and screaming for help, then Dr. Lawrence Gordon tells him that screaming for help is no good because he tried it already, meaning he was awake some time before Adam. How could Adam have been submerged water for so long without drowning? No matter. Bearhug of creepiness. Now, in the neglected industrial bathroom, Adam and Gordon are chained by their ankles to pipes at opposite corners. In the room between them is a dead body with a revolver and a micro cassette recorder loosely in grip. Lawrence and Adam each find tapes in their pockets labeled ""Play Me."" According to the disguised voice on the tape, Adam has to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence must kill Adam before six o'clock, or his wife and daughter will be killed and he will be deserted to die captive in this room. This is the irresistible set up for Saw, one so intelligently designed to inject us with great tension in the first single minute that I dread the idea of ever seeing it in the quintessential modern-day American horror film theatrical experience, surrounded by a nearly sold-out rowdy, shouting, giggling, starting and restless audience. It demands our intention.Its concept, which is unraveled which the crisp enough pace to ensure that we are enduring the suspense, is one which does not just play on our irrational human fears that usually result in horror films like Jaws, Night of the Living Dead or Rosemary's Baby. It connects with true misery, helplessness and paranoia to its terrors. For better or for worse, this is a real breakthrough in the realm of debuts among young fanboy filmmakers. And you can tell that James Wan has some growing up to do: His movie inserts, flashes back, speeds up and machine gun-edits too much. Wan could have intensified the horrific atmosphere by letting an image speak for itself without screaming at us that it's an intense moment.But the talent, ambition and spirit behind his work, not to mention the wit and flair of Australian screenwriter Leigh Whannell, who stars as the panicked Adam, is highly infectious. With the surfacing of the ""torture porn"" genre in the past decade, the Saw film series, together with similarly relentless shockers like Eli Roth's Hostel and Rob Zombie's The Devil's Rejects, is often discerned as an instance of the frequency of manipulatively attractive and stylized graphic violence and gore in contemporary horror films. Nonetheless, Saw is perhaps the very least exploitative of them all, especially Hostel and The Devil's Rejects.Splatter pictures, owing to the wear and tear of special effects and extreme amounts of blood and guts, have a propensity for exhibiting an explicit attraction to the weakness of the body and the sensationalism of its maiming. Saw is, yes, an inordinately violent movie. The word might actually be sadistic. However, Saw's gore and brutality come inherently from its concept, which is designed to horrify us.Saw may be a great horror film, but it is not quite a great film. By and large, its cast gives B- movie performances. There are suspense sequences in which a character makes a glaringly unrealistic choice. Wan needs to mature into a more confident filmmaker with a better understanding of the language of editing. In spite of these things, it's the kind of horror movie of which we need to see more: A horror movie that is as smart as you."
SAW!! Its a film with saws in it!!,29 November 2005,7.0,"HeHe! So many anally retentive movie-buffs out there huh?! It always tickles me to imagine these people, poring over the celluloid like it were a Sudoku puzzle, or the I-Ching, stroking their chins, and looking for a deeper insight into the ineffable motivations of the human soul! Hehe!YOU WENT TO SEE A SERIAL-KILLER MOVIE CALLED ""SAW""!! WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING?? THE MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS?? Hehe!I actually enjoyed the movie. I did, admittedly, see it for free, but with a title like SAW! I was expecting something in the vein of ""Mute - Killer - With - Shiny - Weapon - Dismembers - Hormonal - American - Teenage - CalvinKlein - Model IIX"", only with a little less refined elegance. Bit this hurried, little, no-budget movie, pleasantly surprised me. The claustrophobia gimmick is one close to my heart, I have always enjoyed movies that take a couple of actors and lock them in a room for the duration; something interesting usually ensues, (although I must confess to a little pang of disappointment when the story strayed beyond the confines of the filthy bathroom.), and the notion of a gruesome conundrum, (albeit a join-the-dots one in this case.), seldom fails to pique ones morbid imagination. Yes the acting was barely passable, and the script didn't shed any light on the human condition, but this amusing little romp looked quite pretty, quickened the blood ever-so-slightly, and even provided this jaded viewer with a wry smile as the plot performed its fair attempt at a ""Oh-I-never-SAW-that coming!"" ending.One thing does puzzle me though.... Are most of the posters here American?? I only ask because I've read so many reviewers complaining that ""SAW"" was implausible because the doctors wife didn't blast holes through her hapless, would-be killer, as he lay UNARMED on the floor at gun-point!! I have to wonder how many of these movie-buffs have ever been called upon to shoot another human being...But I digress...At a time when the cookie-cutter movie industry is allowed, nay, encouraged by its consumers to churn out an endless regurgitation of formulaic nonsense, even from its most experienced luminaries, its was almost refreshing to see this ambitious neophyte crew attempt to take a derivative premise and make their mark on an extremely hackneyed genre.Yes, It doesn't break much in the way of new ground. Yes, I'm sure the director has watched far too many MTV videos. Yes, It probably should have been about 25 minutes shorter. And yes, Mad Max did the same gnaw-off-your-own-limb gag many, many moons ago. But hey....Its only a bit of fun. Pass the popcorn!"
awesome movie!,31 January 2005,1.0,"i thought this movie was a great thriller. i wasn't scared by it, but what kept me going was the suspense and the twists. i like how they made all the deaths, they were so gruesome that i couldn't believe it. i was reading some reviews on this DVD and some people said they should release the NC-17 version on DVD. i read an interview with the director James Wan, and all he said that was different in the NC-17 version was the mood, there was no extra scenes or anything. but in all the movie was great as long as you could take seeing some disturbing images and a lot of blood. And first time director James Wan did a great job, and has announced that he's doing a sequel this year of SAW."
Great original idea for the horror genre.,20 October 2012,7.0,I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and everything except the acting blew me away. The story was very creepy and original and it was one of the first movies to fill itself with toture and gore. The story line is great the special effects are very life like the acting is sub par though.This movie is about two men who wake up in a washroom together chained to the wall. They don't know each other but soon they will figure out they share similarities to each other. Figuring out these similarities will be the only way they escape from their tormentors game.This movie was really good. It was scary and is one of the first horror movies in a while to actullay build up a creepy atmosphere without relying on jump scares.
One you shouldn't miss,15 January 2014,7.0,"James Wan the director of Insidious and The Conjuring brings us this psychologically nerve wrecking film. Two men wake up to find they have been chosen to play an insane game of the serial killer Jigsaw. Amazing performances by an all around fantastic cast, this one will leave you with your jaw on the floor. After eight sequels this one is still the best, the most inventive and the only one worth watching again and again. The mix of visionary director James Wan and brilliant script writing of Leigh Whannell make this an instant classic that will forever live in your deepest fears. Those of you who haven't experienced this instant classic are in for one hell of a ride."
Very underrated. Perhaps the best horror film ever made.,6 October 2010,10.0,"Overlooked by many so-called film critics as a low-quality horror piece with no taste and no so-called depth, Saw is one of the best horror films ever made and perhaps even the best among the best.The greatest part of the film, on the contrary to what most people believe before seeing it, is its highly logical and carefully arranged ultra-complex story rather than its presentation of blood and gore. It is the kind of movie where there are tons of totally unpredictable twists and the ending itself stands out as one of the most twisted ones in movie history. In my opinion the story is miles better than that in The Silence of the Lambs, and this alone makes Saw one of the greatest mystery drama films ever too, alongside Memento.Acting on the other hand, is sometimes a little contrived, but sometimes it becomes excessively vivid. Almost every actor/actress does average in average scenes but when horror strikes, their performances become highly believable all in a sudden.Despite the fact that it's not trying to teach you something or to educate you something helpful to being a better man (and forget it, because most films don't), it's a classic that everyone who likes plot- heavy dramas and who doesn't dislike gore/blood should see!Story: 9.8/10 Presentaion (sound/visuals): 9.5/10 Acting and directing: 8.3/10 Atmosphere: 9.0/10Overall: 8.8/10"
MY REVIEW: One of its Kind!!,15 November 2014,10.0,"Saw. The cult gory thriller from James Wan is a pioneer among movies which rely on gory visuals while creating suspense or tension. It is damn good fun while it lasts.The strength of Saw lies in its twists and turns that keep you hooked throughout and imaginative uniqueness of execution from James Wan. Pacing is fast, color tone mostly black and white, characters are twisted, acting overall good enough and length perfectly short of less than 2 hours. If you are seeing it first time, it has enough to startle you but given the disturbing images you might not like it to revisit. I am going with strong 7 out of 10 for Saw. It is something special in horror genre but only for those who do not mind their cinema dark, twisted and disturbing."
Impressive,9 February 2005,7.0,"Hardly ever does a movie open with an interesting premise. But Saw sure is an exception.Sitting at the theater, not sure what to expect, Saw opens with two strangers chained down in a filthy bathroom. Both men are completely puzzled on how they got in that situation so they try to find clues to figure out the bizarre puzzle.It turns out they are the latest victims of the Jigsaw killer, a sadistic maniac who liked to torture people who he believes don't understand the proper way of living life.The plot isn't totally original though it does manage to spin some original ideas into it.Normally movies like these end up straight to video, while the total garbage hits theaters. Luckily this hit theaters and let's hope there's more little gems like these that make it to the big screen."
Well Above My Expectations,20 February 2005,7.0,"After hearing mixed feedback from reviews and comments made by others who had seen the film, i wasn't expecting too much from SAW. I WAS WRONG! Entirely Dark and Creepy, Saw successfully engages your attention, provides many shocks and scares that are perfectly blended with a strong story.SAW achieves what too many Horror/Serial Killer movies only strive for, Undying Tension and an original plot, where the viewer is fed each revelation and twist at the right time so that the truth unfolds subtly, and the shock effect is maximised.With a budget of around $1 Million and a debut outing for writer/director James Wan, the result is stunning, and i feel this young talent has a great future ahead of him. Even with some fairly weak acting and an occasional low budget feel, Wan has still created one the finest horror/serial killer movies ever. This would equal Seven or Silence of the Lambs if the Cast was of the same calibre.A brilliant Debut, an original Film, and a fantastic achievement. Great work, and i look forward to the sequel.9/10"
Freaky enough,27 July 2007,9.0,"Following the hype, I must say that I expected more from this movie. Still, the entertainment value was very high, I did not get bored a single time. The basic concept is good and freaky enough. The dark, cold and stinky atmosphere was justly portrayed. However, there were some things missing that could've made this movie a true classic. Maybe there are too many flashbacks, police investigation scenes, etc. to get truly absorbed into the main story of the two men chained in a sleazy bathroom. What's more, I was not really impressed by the choice of actors. I never got to the point of empathizing with the characters, and therefore I was not so concerned with their fates (which lessens the tension). More character building would've helped a lot.Also, more focus on the dreadfulness of lying hours in a row as a caged dog in a desolate place would've been welcome: I understand, including a minute or two of silent trepidation would be risky in the commercial eye, but I am convinced it would add to the overall texture of the movie. I also expected more gore and bloodiness; if somebody has to pull a key out of another person's stomach, show more of the actual action. If the doctor is sawing his leg, well, include at least a second more of the sawing or of the sawed-off foot/leg (then again, my own stomach says thank you for not showing that¬Ö) The last factor which did damage to the absorption level was the logic of action taken. If Big Brother can hear all that's happening in the bathroom, why can't he hear what's being said between the two victims when the light is turned off? And is it not oh so obvious for BB that they made a deal with regard to the poisoned cigarette? When (near the end of the movie) the doctor reaches for the cell phone, he gets frustrated for not reaching it. Hey, you managed to pick up things that were harder to pick up by either man just throwing another object towards it, so why cutting off your foot to do it now? To add some praise: the end scene was totally unexpected, though very conceivable and thus of true perfection."
"If the ending were a hamburger....bruh, it'd be the best, most intense damn hamburger imaginable.....",17 October 2005,9.0,"About a year ago, I gave a my two cents on Saw when it first came out. Back then, I was being to critical towards it, and really stuck up about it. After watching it over about four times, I finally enjoyed it, and realized that there was some bad-assness in this movie. Now, I bring to you a better review, a bad-ass review, a review so good that my previous review is in this review's morning craps!!Like I said, back then I didn't like this movie because I was looking too hard. I was expecting a deep movie with sharp plausibility. Then, as I watched this over, I realized, why the hell does this movie need it anyways? It's got a good story, a bad-ass ending, and lots of grungy violence. What more could you ask for, WHAT MORE?!The story is this: Two men, Adam and Lawrence, wake up in a dirty, broken down bathroom, chained to the walls. In the middle of the room is a dead guy. In the dead guys hands are a tape recorder and a gun. The stench in the air¬Ö..is misery, bruh. Lawrence is told that if he doesn't get out before 6 in the morning, his family will be killed. Adam doesn't have much to lose, except most likely his life. They don't really do much in the time they're given. They find a bunch of clues, they're called on a cell phone and threatened, and also, they're given a hacksaw. The only way to get out is to cut through their feet. Now, if I'm wrong, which I'm not, is that a good story or is that a good story? It turns out, a crazy bastard named Jigsaw is behind this. He kidnaps people, puts them in dangerous situations, and finds ways for them to kill themselves. The acting isn't what you would call that great, but there's a legitimate reason: The actors didn't really have any rehearsals because the budget was so low, so it's forgiven. But, as the movie goes on, the acting gets better, especially in the parts that need good acting.Now, Saw doesn't really have any scary moments, even though it should. But I figure, if the movie's entertaining, who cares? There's nothing really scary in this movie, but does that mean it isn't intense? No, it doesn't. There's only a few intense scenes in the movie: One involving a dude in his underwear tying to get out of a barbed wire maze thing, and the ending. My God, the ending. The ending is kind of like a slap in the face to the audience, but who cares? You absolutely do not expect to see what you're gonna see. When you see what you see at the very end, you're seriously wondering, ""What the F, bruh?! How's that happening?!"" The ending is so damn intense, you'll wonder how on Earth you can take it. Even though there's some stupid dialogue and setups, the movie still does what it wants to: It entertains. It's not scary, but it has some intense moments, and it's grungier than something that's really grungy. Obviously, these people had fun making it, and it was an overall cool movie. Don't look for something deep when you watch it, either.This is a cool movie. Hopefully, part 2 will be just as cool. Also, some Gwar tunes would have been good, but unnecessary, so don't hate it for not having any.Score: 8 out of 10."
"One of the best horror/thrillers since The Shining, and possibly the best ending ever-----8/10",9 May 2006,7.0,"Saw crept up on us like Jigsaw creeps on his victim. Completely out of nowhere but not easily forgotten. The movie starts of in a large bathroom where two men are chained up and a dead man is lying between them. They don't who each other is or how they got there. The script by Leigh Whannell (who also plays one of the captives) is ingeniously clever and very twisted especially when showing different victims in various booby traps and deadly. My favorite is the guy that is locked in a room with numbers all over the wall. A taped message tells him there is poison in his veins and that the antidote is locked in a safe in the room. The combo to the safe is hidden in the numbers on the wall. However, the room is dark and he has to use a candle, but his body is smeared with a flammable goop. Oh and there is broken glass shards on the floor. Now only a truly sick individual can come up with something like that. The movie really isn't as gory as many people believe, but it wouldn't make a difference in a movie that actually relies on mystery rather than horror. The whole movie is really solid, but the part that makes the movie a highly rewatchable classic is the brilliant ending. I promise you will be shocked at the ending. Even after the third viewing it had my heart pounding through my chest. This movie also kicked off an interest in me for independent films. They seem to be made with more TLC than most Hollywood stuff, but of course since this movie made big bucks at the box office it is turning into a franchise with two sequels in two years. Neither will be as entertaining as the original and not too many movies have the ability to make you watch it over and over. Bravo! 8/10"
A new hope for the horror genre...,13 March 2005,7.0,"Despite a few obvious flaws and a couple of understandable logic-errors, James Wan's debut ""Saw"" definitely is one of the best horror projects of the last fifteen years. It finally is a film that dares to shock again! Most recent horror films politely request whether it's okay or not to scare you now, while ""Saw"" ¬ñ much like cult hits from the 60's and 70's ¬ñ just grab you by the throat and doesn't let go before the end credits start to role. That's what this genre is all about! It's not about how 100% waterproof the script is or how Oscar-worthy the acting is....we need shocks, bitterness and madness! Wan doesn't waste any time, as the story begins with two men waking up in a filthy old restroom, chained to the wall and separated by and corpse holding a gun. Still unaware of where they are and what they did to deserve this, Adam (a photographer) and Lawrence (an adulterous surgeon) are given the order to survive this situation by killing the other, using the attributes hidden somewhere in the room. It soon becomes clear that they were captured by the notorious ""Jigsaw"" killer...an extremely violent but intelligent serial murderer whose identity is still a mystery to the police and whose only motive and grudge seems to go out to people who're ungrateful to be alive. Wan and co-writer Whannel did their best to stuff the plot with so many twists and turns that you eventually stop to guess along in the killer's identity but the climax is overall satisfying and ingenious enough to be praiseworthy. The very best aspects, however, are the very imaginative ""games"" that the killer has thought up for his/her victims! These sequences (mostly shown through flashbacks) are utterly demented, grim and most certainly not meant for the eyes of the squeamish! I wanted more of them, actually...Truly disturbing also is the use of eerie scenery (masks, dark set pieces, torture machines) and sound effects. The gore is not overwhelming ¬ñ thank God ¬ñ but several sequences are quite repulsive and there even are a couple of authentic ""jump"" sequences. It's true that the acting, of nearly the entire cast, is abominable and at times even downright irritating. Maybe it's because all the washed up actors and actresses (there are quite a few ""departed glory"" stars here: Cary Elwes, Dany Glover, Monica Potter, Dina Meyer...) are just disappointed in their careers or maybe the young director Wan still lacks the talent to guide his cast into the right performances. I sure didn't allow the acting to ruin the rest of the film for me. When you watch horror a lot, you'll quickly learn that atrocious acting can't be too much of an obstacle. This is probably a film that will raise even more questions and unravel more mistakes when you watch it the second time around, but at least the first viewing is impressive and ensuring horror buffs that they're beloved genre is not yet dead and buried."
Did you see Saw? I saw Saw and what I saw was....,27 July 2015,5.0,"NOT BAD! I'd really like for the Motion Picture Academy to have ""Best Horror Film."" Heck, maybe they do; I'm not sure! However, IF they did, I would think that Saw-1 could have been a nominee. Then again, it wouldn't have been called ""Saw-1"" at that time since there's been about 27 additional Saw movies since. Okay. Well, only six additional ""Saws.""I read that the shooting budget was $700,000. They went a tad over at 1.2 million smackers! But Saw took in just over $103 million worldwide! That's a nice ROI! BTW, 55 million of that 103 came from North America. Not unexpected.SPOILER COMING!!They set up the way Saw (Saw-1) ended, believing there almost HAD to be a sequel (or six!) Ironically, good old Jiggy (Tobin Bell), spent 99.73% of camera time taking a nap. That part was quite absurd. Look, these aren't amongst the most credible movies, but the idea the Jiggy could lay there face down with a pool of ""blood"" around him and not even pass wind once in the hours he was idle, and not even be seen breathing, is just way too much for me. I guess he would have had to have Depends on.The story go somewhat dull around 60 percent in before it picked up pace when Danny Glover started chasing Zeppers towards the end. However, all-in-all, as stated, the film wasn't bad for its genre leading me torn between 6.5 and 7 on the rating scale here.If you haven't seen it, I suppose you may not. But if you do, I'd love to hear your opinion....thanks for reading mine!I have a game to play.....Gotta run!"
Imagine if Ed Wood re-did Seven and this is what it would look like- the worst film of the year so far,30 October 2004,5.0,"(Possible spoilers)I was immensely grateful not to have paid to watch this film (snuck in); because if I did I would've felt un-clean once the credits began to roll. The filmmakers, writer/director James Wan and writer/actor Leigh Whannell, have concocted another story in what Hollywood finds as the popular Silence of the Lambs/Se7en vein. The premise sounds like it might have promise- two guys (Whannell and Cary Elwes) are chained up in some abhorrent tub-room, and are given two saws. They have to find a way out, or else Dr. Gordon's (Elwes) wife and daughter will be killed. Then the rest of the story takes off, and it's down-hill. What happens then are a series of flashbacks, tracing how they got in there, how a cop (Danny Glover, a sad state of affairs to see him in this) gets maddened by the cases and an encounter, and how the gory details of the cases emphasize how disturbed and 'scary' the Jigsaw killer is (whom we never really see, except for a clown-type of face that's more of something to laugh at than anything else).The problem with this film, the chief one among others, is that Wan and Whannell underestimate the audience's intelligence. Everything has to be explained, and with a style in bold, gruesome type that end up not coming off as successfully scary as successfully sadistic (and there is a big difference between something being effective and not- last year's Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake is a prime example). They seem to care more (along with their editor and cinematographer and production designer) to drum up the atmosphere. But they spend so much time going over the top in many cases (and this includes with Wan's direction of actors, which brings out some bad performances, even out of co-writer Whannel) that they don't set up characters we can really sympathize for. In fact, at some point, it becomes so tiresome with how the plot dances around; you almost want them to get it over with it so that the Jigsaw guy can go on to his next abomination. What's worse is that when the third act comes around, all the elements produce material that becomes laughable, and not because we (or at least I was, the audience around me were much the same) are laughing at the sadism of it, but because it's so ridiculous. Se7evn and Silence of the Lambs spent far more time setting up the good guys, or at least making they seem like strong forces we could identify with, and at the same time the story lines weren't completely unbelievable. At some point while watching Saw, I found it to be like if some hack (i.e. Ed Wood) decided to re-do Se7en except to focus on the victims instead of the cops, to dance around the storyline like they're going farther than Tarantino, and that by the end everyone who deserved to die (except for a few) do. Then I realized, it's like, it is. I don't discourage the 27 year old Wan and Whannell from some kind of potential in Hollywood, but I just don't see it here. D-"
Very bloody and scary!!!!,7 June 2021,8.0,"This movie would give 100 %satisfaction to lovers of horror thriller genre of movies.intense bloody scenes,nerve wrecking thrill,and suspense got me to edge of my seat!!!"
See Saw,26 September 2009,8.0,"Let the games begin. And so they did in the original 'Saw.' Crafty, original, simple and suspenseful this mystery/horror 'Saw' was. The unfortunate biggest flaw was not really the movie itself, but the torn-porn trend Hollywood jumped on and since, produced dozens upon dozens of imitations and far less quality pictures (including 'Saw's own sequels.) Aside from that, I was quite pleased, though disturbed (with the violence and gore) with the concept of a serial killer that doesn't kill. In 'Saw,' two men wake up in the dirtiest of scummy bathrooms, chained and armed with a mission (rules, if you will) to not only put all the pieces together on how to survive, but how to decipher on the reasons behind their imprisonment. Multiple flashbacks and exterior shots, whether presently or in the past, make the viewer actually think for once and try and solve their dilemma as well. I'm simplifying this, it was a great concept, and despite the low budget, excellently made. For those not used to horror, or in the trend previously mentioned: ""torture porn,"" this is not for the squeamish. It's enormously gruesome and hard to watch at times. However, I liked the message, though it was a rough ride to get to it. And the message? Simple: Appreciate life. If one can get past the gore and really listen to what the brains behind the operations ‚Äì Jigsaw, then you'll get it too. In fact, take this as a lesson and go out to enjoy life now, before something like this happens to you. I'm kidding ‚Äì I certainly hope this never happens. Years after Freddy, Jason, the 'Scream' ghost, Hannibal, et al, Jigsaw stands amongst them and played beautifully by the actor playing him. (No spoiler on who it is; that's part of the game.)"
I wanna play a game.....,25 February 2012,9.0,"Two men wake up at opposite sides of a dirty, disused bathroom, chained by their ankles to pipes.Between them lies a dead man loosely clutching a hand-held tape player and a handgun. Each finds a tape the perfect fit for the player in their back pocket.They play the tapes. One is threatened, the other isn't. But they have a task: One must kill the other by 6:00, or his wife and daughter will die.They are the two newest victims of the Jigsaw Killer.Through a series of flashbacks, we learn of more victims, and of the nearly-successful capture of the Jigsaw Killer, who doesn't actually kill his victims.Instead, he finds ways to make them kill either themselves, or each other, and he thinks the entire 'game' out perfectly....This is one of those movies that is never the same when you watch it for the second time, but it's still a great viewing pleasure, as it answers so many questions you may have asked first time around.The plot is simple, but what makes the film work so well is the fluid narrative, and intricate storytelling using flashbacks between the two men, Jigsaw, and Danny Glover.Each of these four people have a different story throughout the movie, but it all leads back to that one room.It's obviously not for weak stomachs, and the film has spawned several sequels, some good, some not.But the best thing about this film is Jigsaw, a 'villain' you actually have empathy for in some strange way, as for once, he is a human being, dying,and want to make people appreciate life.It's well worth seeing, and you really don't need to see the other six with this, but seeing them in one full swoop, t's quite a good story.But Elwes' face does get way too pale at the end, he looks like a Cullen."
"Better than average horror flick, but could have been much better...",25 February 2005,9.0,"This was a pretty decent movie (compared to others in the genre) but the plot holes, flawed logic, and small annoyances really keep it from being great.The best thing I can say about ""Saw"" is that it will definitely surprise and shock you. There are some great plot twists, even for the most cynical film buffs. It is engrossing and has a tendency to trap you in the claustrophobic terror along with its characters. In most ways, it delivers what you are expecting and wanting after seeing the trailers.The worst thing I can say about ""Saw"" is that it falls short of its potential. The fright and excitement dies down when the plot goes limp a few times. The characters lose your attention when the script goes weak at points. If you focus on these aspects too much it will only frustrate you and take away your enjoyment of an otherwise good movie.The saddest thing about these shortcomings is that with a little ironing out ""Saw"" could have been a really great movie instead of merely good. However, for something that was written by two new screenwriters and shot in 18 days, it is commendable.Better than average? Yes. Worth seeing? Yes. Fun? Hell yes.Enjoy."
Saw,8 October 2016,7.0,"""Saw"" is a smart, tense, psychological horror/thriller that nowadays, thanks to its awful sequels and the many imitators it spawned, is passed off as a cheap torture porn.The first scene is an intriguing setup: A man wakes up in a grimy, dark bathroom, in the bath. He gets out and hears a deep voice speaking to him. The lights come on, it turns out someone else is in the room and he also has no idea what is happening. Also, there's a dead body in the center of the room. The mysteries unravel one by one mostly through a series of flashbacks. While this constant switching between time and place may seem like a jarring structure, the transitions between these scenes are handled very well by James Wan, the director. The cutting back and forth actually aids the film, since it leaves constant mystery and suspense throughout the entire film. Literally, the entire film.The suspense and mystery of the film is mostly character based. Everyone in the film has a reason for where they are. These are not the usual clich√© horror film archetypes. First, the two men who are trapped together. Adam is a private eye who basically exposes people for money, and he's impatient and easily angered. Lawrence Gordon is a doctor, who cheats on his wife, but he isn't an entirely terrible person. He does love his daughter and it seems he wants to change. Then there's David Tapp, who becomes incredibly obsessed with this case, to the point of rushing into Jigsaw's hideout without a warrant and with his partner, Detective Sing, who is killed by Jigsaw, the murderer, during their ambush. Tapp then only falls more into obsession, driven by his guilt from the death of his partner. Then, of course, there is Jigsaw, who has severe cancer and is fed up seeing others who don't appreciate their lives, so he creates these elaborate torture scenarios which will make the victim appreciate their lives more if they escape. Of course, all of this is revealed slowly throughout the film, but that doesn't mean it was slow paced. There is constantly a new mystery to focus on in this film.The cinematography has a gritty, grimy feel to it constantly that fits the depravity of the characters well. The quick editing increases the tension of many situations, such as when the detectives go into the abandoned mannequin factory to find Jigsaw, which is also a notable scene for incorporating the extent of Tapp's obsession into the moment when he decides to ""see what Jigsaw does"" rather than attempt to save the man who is about to be killed. Even in this intense moment, the film is able to develop the character. There are many other genuinely frightening sequences, such as when Adam goes looking for the man in his dark house with nothing but a camera flash, as well as the moment where Lawrence is kidnapped and the moments leading up to it. James Wan knows that in order for a moment to be truly scary, you must hint that there's something there, but not specify what. The fear of the unknown is infinitely scary than all the blood and guts you can imagine. Speaking of which, the film is actually much less gory than people make it out to be, and when there is gore, and don't get me wrong, there is some gruesome imagery, but it is not overdone to the point where it becomes ineffective. It will shock you every time because it is never shown in detail for more than a few seconds.A very good horror/thriller that, judging by the end of this one, received many unjustified sequels."
