"One of my favorite movies of all time!","31 October 2003","10/10","Seriously, I know that sounds stupid as this is an animated movie, but why can't we have a favorite movie that's animated? If you ask me this is Disney's best animated film of all time. Why do you ask? The animation is just beautiful, the story is powerful and moving, the characters are terrific, the villain is one of Disney's most monstrous and the songs are out of this world incredible! Not only is it my favorite animated movie, this is one of my favorite soundtracks, with the strong power of Elton John The Lion King is absolutely beautiful and a pleasure to watch still to this day. I have to say also that this story is just so beautiful, it's still one of the movies that will always bring a tear to my eye. When I was 17 years old, I begged my dad to take me to the re-release of The Lion King, him and I being the only adults besides the parents who took their children to see the movie, Simba's father dies and I started balling! My dad looks around and said ""Krissy, stop it!"" and I just said ""But it's so saaaaad! Simba's daddy!"", yes I'm a sap, I can't help it, this is a powerful movie.In the Pride Lands, Rafiki, a wise old monkey, anoints Simba, the newborn cub of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, and presents him to a gathering of animals at Pride Rock. Taking advantage of the cub's naive nature, Simba's scheming uncle Scar, who is very angry because Simba's birth means that he's no longer next in line to the throne tells him about the elephant graveyard, a place where Mufasa has forbidden Simba to go. Simba asks his mother if he can go to the water-hole with his best friend, Nala, but they go to the graveyard instead. There, the cubs are met by Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, 3 hyenas who try to kill them, but they are rescued by Mufasa. But Scar doesn't give up there, he lures Simba into a gorge for a ""surprise from his father"" while the hyenas create a wildebeest stampede. Alerted by Scar, Mufasa races to rescue Simba from the stampede. He saves his son but is left clinging to the edge of a steep cliff. Scar flings his brother into the stampede below. Simba sees his father fall and rushes down the cliff after him, only to find him dead. Scar convinces Simba that he was responsible for his father's death and recommends that he runs away from the Pride Lands to avoid punishment. In a distant desert, Simba is found unconscious by Timon and Pumbaa, a duo who adopt and raise the cub under their worry-free philosophy, Hakuna Matata. When Simba has grown into an adult he is discovered by Nala, who tells him that Scar, through his irresponsibility, has turned the Pride Lands into a barren wasteland. She asks Simba to return and take his place as king but Simba refuses, still believing he caused his father's death. Rafiki arrives and persuades Simba to return to the Pride Lands, and face Scar once and for all.I know that still that Beauty and the Beast is the only animated film to get a best picture nomination, but I don't understand why The Lion King didn't get the same treatment. I adore this film with such a passion, I will always defend it to the high end. I still watch this movie, ever since it's theatrical release in 1994, I still sing, dance, and rehears the lines back and forth. How could you not at least with Hakuna Matata? Timon is my idol, he's so care free, funny, and awesome during his drag hula scene ""Luau! If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat, eat my buddy Pumbaa here, 'cause he's a tasty treat come on down and dine, on this tasty swine, all you gotta is get in line, are you achin',? For some bacon? He's a big pig. You can be a big pig, too. Oy! Ahhhh!"", best scene ever in film history! OK, not in history, but one of my favorites, it always has me on the floor laughing till my stomach hurts. If you seriously haven't seen this movie, see it! Who said that animated movies can't be true art? The Lion King is a fantastic film and deserves all it's praise and more.10/10"
"A Film For All Ages","20 January 2000","10/10","This is a film that can entertain anyone young or old, I usually don't care for animated movies but this film is the real deal, this is one of disney's best animated movies. The animation is top notch and flawless. This film also features superb work from the vocal cast James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg. This is a standout."
"The Best Animated Film I Have Ever Seen","1 January 2000","10/10","The Lion King is a great film.  Along with a great story (inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet), terrific animation, and an all star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children).  Like responsibility and honor.I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen.  It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget.  And hopefully, you won't either.  A++"
"The best Disney animated film ever...","10 May 2005","10/10","The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! My personal favorite character is Rafiki, the Baboon! I still cant forget the line he says to Simbe, ""Past can hurt, but as I see it, you can either run from it, or learn from it!"" it is so true! i loved Zazu's weirdness, and shenzi's humor, above all, i loved Pumba's innocence and Timon's intelligence! In short, i found the film the best film ever... The voice cast is also great. Mathew did complete justice to Simba, and what can I say about Mufasa, He is the best King, and dad anyone can ever get! The movie is not meant for kids, its meant to teach every adult a lesson...to find our place in the great ""Circle Of Life"". I give this film a perfect 10."
"This is what kid's movies should be like...","7 August 2006","10/10","I find it hard to believe that kid's movies these days will ever be called classics in years to come (excluding Pixar movies). In my mind, this is the last classic hand drawn film, and it upsets me that I have to wait for another five years for it to come out on DVD. This film deals with great issues and involves a huge conflict for the main character, something that recent kid/family films lack. It is funny and lighthearted when it should be, and heartfelt and serious when it needs it. I believe that everybody should see this movie, regardless of your age. It may just be the last good movie that Disney will ever do without the help of Pixar."
"By far, the greatest Disney movie ever made...","22 April 2002","10/10","This movie is, quite seriously, the Citizen Kane of Disney animation. Every animated movie from Disney ever since has been a failed attempt to recreate the masterpiece that this film is. This movie is an anomaly in a market usually dominated by formulaic kiddie-fare. Unlike most films from animation studios, this movie will enthrall you, whether you're 5 years old, or 50. An epic plot, intriguing characters, great music and hillarious moments make this film a family classic that will endure through the ages. 10/10"
"TLK is Great","21 December 2005","10/10","I watched the film today and I have come to the conclusion that this Disney film is one classic that will keep on delivering to Disney fans like myself...TLK is a wonderful film with great characters and songs with a powerful message that you can always find your way back no matter how hard the journey...I think The Lion King is one of the best Disney animated films matching with the power of Bambi and Brother Bear.I love how Disney Works hard to deliver the best in Animation,Song,And MagicI do believe that 2006 and many years from now The Lion King will Shine and still Roar with Success...Thank-You Disney For The Lion King"
"Masterpiece, the new one doesnt compare","21 July 2019","10/10","Watched the new one, and I think I had a disgusted look on my face the entire time. The music, the visuals, the dialogue, the voice acting, etc. Rewatched this one and remembered why this was my favorite Disney movie growing up. From mufasa's death to the goofy hyenas, to the bond between rafiki, simba and mufasa. The music that everyone knows every word to, and scar's ability to deliver each line perfectly. This movie is magic, the new one seems to tech focused and forgot what made lion king so beloved to begin with, its unfortunate. Hoping the circle of life makes it way around and the end of remakes draws close (see what I did there lol). Until then, lion king from the 90s will stay on my shelf and my kids will watch with me. This new one will never end up in my cart and I wont confuse my kids by watching it either. Thank you 90s Disney for the magic!"
"A living masterpiece","28 November 2005","9/10","This is truly one of the best Disney movies ever. I really enjoyed it when I first seen it, about when I was 6, and since then I watched it over and over again. I simply LOOOOVED the music. It's one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. And, speaking of soundtrack, I just can't tell in words how much I love the song ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"". Is one of my favorite songs ever. I truly believe that this motion picture could easily be nominated for The Best Picture, but The Best Song and the Best Original Score is really enough. I wonder if they will ever think to make a prequel of this movie in order to understand who is Mufasa, Scar, Sarabi and the other characters. In short, this movie will be remembered in the next 100 years. Truly."
"The Lion King: 9/10","28 December 2002","7/10","Released Christmas Day in 2002 to IMAX and large format screens, The Lion King makes a triumphant return to the screen after eight years. Its every bit as majestic and great as it has been before.The Lion King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) just had a baby cub named Simba. All of the animals come to the ceremony, except for Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons). Scar desperately wants to be King, but can't. As long as Mufasa and Simba are there. Soon Simba is able to walk and talk and is voiced by Jonathon Taylor Thomas. After hearing about an elephant graveyard from Scar, he and his friend Nala (Niketa Calame) visit it. They meet three bumbling hyenas: Banzai (Cheech Marin), Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), and Ed (Jim Cummings), but they manage to leave unhurt. Scar is upset that the hyenas didn't do the job, so he orders a stampede to wipe out both of them, but it only takes care of Mufasa. Scar convinces Simba that he killed Mufasa, not Scar. So Simba flees into exile.The Lion King really benefits from the larger screen. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more, and you can really savor the animation. Disney didn't need any humans, so they could spend all of the time on a great story and lush landscapes. In fact, its camera movement was so majestic that you actually felt like you were part of the pride of lions.The music boomed and really created the atmosphere. Although I had seen this picture before, I still was tense because of the way the music played out. Most of the time, I would just roll my eyes at the attempt to make me nervous. But Hans Zimmer's music really bowled me over and made my heart do calisthenics. Unlike such new Disney pics like Lilo and Stitch, the songs actually did some good. They took you out of a somewhat dreary mood and put a smile on your face and made your feet want to tap along. There were only a few, but they were very entertaining. And the Circle of Life song at the beginning was beautiful, with its perfect pictures and perfect sound.I really like James Earl Jones (he's pretty diverse), and this time was no exception. He seemed to act like he didn't want to do this role, but he couldn't contain his excitement for wanting to do voice-overs again (he had done some work in The Simpsons before). Matthew Broderick redeemed himself for me (after the atrocious Ferris Bueller's Day Off) by showing a strong voicing as the adult Simba. Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jim Cummings really had good chemistry together, even though they didn't have much screen time. Irons was really good and creepy as Scar (one of those who you can't help but hate), and if that is him really singing, brava!Be warned, The Lion King isn't really for youngsters. It had intense thematic elements that should have warranted a PG, instead of those that don't deserve it (Lilo and Stitch, again). The mood that the music and the script brought out could damper your day, so be warned.This is one movie where you can feel for the characters. You don't say `haha, he's dead', you say `Gasp! I'm so sad!' If it weren't for the gifted scriptwriters, this movie would be kaput and a nothing, not the best Disney movie ever made.The Lion King is a majestic movie, not without humor, that is for almost all to see.My rating: 9/10Rated G for intense thematic elements."
"Very good, But not Disney's best like everyone claims","10 February 2014","9/10","The Lion King is viewed by most as the peak in Disney's renaissance period and remains, to this date, the highest grossing 2D animated film of all time. With Disney on such a high expectations were, while this was increased by the superb vocal talent and wonderful animation, and for many those expectations were met. Though a lot are going to disagree with me, I have to come out and say that I think the film is kind of overrated. That doesn't mean I dislike it as a matter of fact I agree that it does have fantastic elements, but for the heaps of praise it gets I'm not sure if it holds up well enough.The story is effectively a toned down Hamlet. A lion prince named Simba is born, meaning that his cruel uncle Scar is now second in line to the throne. Scar plots to kill both King Mufasa and Simba, succeeding in killing Mufasa and making Simba believe he was at fault. Simba flees the kingdom and remains in exile for a number of years, until figures of the past challenge him and he must return home to take his rightful place as king. The story is a very interesting one, it is a much more mature than you would expect from Disney and I really enjoy it for that reason. Everything that happens seems to happen for a reason and there isn't any filler as far as the plot goes. After all this is a very big story and telling it in a cohesive mature manner works very well.The other impressive feature is the animation. It's clear that the animators put a lot of work in to create such a visually pleasing place for this to all happen in. The colours used give the place such a bright beautiful look and it is actually quite authentic looking too. Scenes of bird flying over the vivid landscape or of the sun shining over the land are so beautiful to look at. The character designs were also very good, like the contrast between the powerful Mufasa and the slimy Scar. The sheer scope of things is another wonderful aspect, such as when Scar's paw first comes down or the later Wildebeest stampede. Even things like the backgrounds look massive which gives an extra size to this world.The characters are rather hit and miss. Simba is a bit of a bland lead, he is just a kid for most of it but he does come off as a bit too boring and even obnoxious at times. He doesn't get any better the older he gets and Matthew Broderick's voice only adds to the dullness. Mufasa is just a brilliant character. He is designed wonderfully, has some really interesting characteristics and James Earl Jones' booming voice is perfect for it. A lot of people rate Scar as a top villain yet for me he's just decent. He is enjoyably devious and Jeremy Irons clearly has fun with the role, but he does come off as not that smart and a bit snivelling in the end. Zazu is very funny with Rowan Atkinson delivering some good lines and Rafiki is also very likable for coming across as a good friend. I'm not a big fan of Timon and Pumbaa as they come off as a bit annoying and wink at the camera too much, though they do have some amusing scenes. The Hyenas were daft but entertaining, while I think Nala was underplayed too much.I do have issues with the film. The message that it is trying to get across is an interesting one in how we must learn from the past to move forward. The problem is that when Simba confronts his past nobody believes him until Scar says what really happened. Looking at this you can't help but feel Simba would have been better off lying and that harms the whole point of the message. Also I think a lot of the comedic elements feel very misplaced. For a story as grand and serious as this I can't help but find that the comedy is too trivial at times which is distracting. As mentioned Timon and Pumbaa just feel a bit misplaced because they're jokes are slightly too silly. If done well, like with Zazu or the hyenas antics, then its nice relief but otherwise it doesn't work.Also I really find that the songs are a mixed bag. 'I Just Can't Wait to be King' and 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' just come off as your typical pop songs and there isn't anything truly catchy or memorable about them. 'Hakuna Matata' is another one everyone loves, but for me it's just annoying. On the other hand however, 'Circle of Life' is a brilliantly grand number that opens the film perfectly and 'Be Prepared' is really catchy with some very enjoyable singing from Jeremy Irons. Elsewhere there are some really memorable sequences here. The circle of life opening is something that everyone should remember, the wildebeest chase is visually stunning as well as pulse-pounding, Simba talking to Mufasa in the clouds is sadly beautiful and the final battle sequence does have some great images. Also I thought it was very brave decision to actually show the body of Mufasa after his death. In fact going on from that the movie does have a very strong emotional core running throughout that is very welcoming and smartly used.On the whole I do think that The Lion King is a very accomplished piece from Disney, I just don't find it as engaging as most people do. This is a big story with a lot of big elements, I just find that whilst most of the work some of them aren't quite as successful. I do wish other Disney films were as acclaimed as The Lion King, but I still find an entertaining and well-made film."
"great film","23 August 2017","7/10","this was, and still is,a great movie I love it, and hope that everyone gets to experience it for themselves, I've watched it many times and it is always good no matter how many times you have seen it,the songs are great and so are all the characters and the story is incredible, great for all ages and I really recommend it to anyone who hasn't already watched it."
"one of the best children's movies from my child hood","16 October 2012","3/10","This movie was such a sweet heartwarming tale. It had its funny moments its action it really is a perfect movie for the kids. And for the adults the acting was great and it had a very good story very predictable but not when I was a kid.This movie is about a young lion cub ""Simba"" who is tricked into thinking he was responsible for his fathers death so ridden with guilt he leaves the pride and goes off on his own. He grows up on his own but meets lifelong friends on the way.This was such an adorable tale. Everyone is sure to love this movie exspecially the kids but the adults will find it very sweet and heartwarming as well."
"Overrated pap","27 December 2011","10/10","A little balance, I hope, to offset the rants of some of the single-star-ers: after years of having ""The Lion King"" simmering in the background of my film-going conscience, we finally bought it for the kids for Christmas and watched it tonight for the first and, at least for me, last time.The Simba/Kimba thing has been mentioned here enough, so I'm going to focus on this from a story-and-character point of view.  half-hearted (read: rather pathetic) attempt at explaining away the ""we eat animals but when we die we become grass so what goes around etc."" concept (or restated, the prey animals know their place in the big picture and consent to being eaten  nice if you're the lion), but let's not get too deep into the mythologies this film supports (patriarchy-as-common-sense, benevolent dictators, ma-'n'-pa family model as the ideal, Africa as one big national park)  poor character development. Simba is just shallow and his change of heart towards the end is cheesy.  by comparison with films like ""Toy Story"" or even the ""Ice Age"" franchise, the writers simply seemed to lack imagination. Perhaps they cancelled each other out, considering that this was definitely not the brainchild of a single writer whatever, the result is pretty watery  Scar is barely scary, nor is his scar ever explained. He comes off as being effete and lazy and conniving, which is fine, but like all the other characters here he's completely two-dimensional from start to finish. A mediocre villain at best.  A lot of the Americanisms in the dialogue left me cold: this was clearly pitched at a Disney-loving US-English audience  Mostly cheesy humor. Second time I've used cheesy here, must mean something. Lots of mediocre puns, a few good ones. And somehow, references in films like this to classic lines from far more adult and accomplished films like ""In the Heat of the Night"" and ""Taxi Driver"" (both get a nod from Pumbaa in his ""Are you talking to *me*? -- THEY CALL ME MR. PIG!"" sequence) come off as cheap and Disney-American in the worst sense. Some brightish moments when Fuzu is the unwilling object of a ""pounce"" lesson and the look on Nala's face after her dip in the pond, some decent character voice work from Rowan Atkinson and Jeremy Irons despite the lines they were given.  Characters appear at opportune moments with no sense of them being there for any other reason than an easy out on the writers' part: Musafa rescuing Simba from the hyenas, e.g. or Simba rescuing Timon and Pumbaa from Nala.  The orchestral music is overblown, the songs largely forgettable. Strange, considering the involvement of Tim Rice. I'll leave Elton out of this: apart from ""Tommy"" I was never a fan. Although Timon's anti-romance intro to ""Can you feel the love tonight"" is pretty good (just the intro, though).  Just why the heck did the river run dry just because Scar took over the pride?  For a ""family film"" this is pretty high on the violence scale, not least the slow motion and totally uninspired slugfest between Simba and Scar.  Enormous plot holes and missing info: Did Simba really get that big and strong on bugs alone? Why did Scar have so much access to little Simba when Mustafa obviously mistrusted his brother? Where was Simba's mum all this time? Just how did Simba pull himself back onto that rock at the end when Scar had him dead to rights? Etcetera.  Some egregious examples of explaining away plot points in the dialogue, especially how Nala just happens to stumble across Simba again.  Cloying and sentimental far too much of the time.Okay, that's my two cents for now. I could go on, but would it be worth the effort? The best I can hope for is to persuade a couple of potential viewers to make better use of their time than with soft-boiled tripe like this."
"simply a wonderful, heartfelt tale for all ages","14 March 2002","10/10","Delightful animated feature from Walt Disney Pictures about a naive young lion cub destined for greatness. Born the son of a beloved and authoritative king he's groomed to be the next ruler of the kingdom, but along the way he encounters tragic detours at the hands of his villainous uncle and scheming hyena henchmen. Years later—as an adult—he decides to embrace his destiny and take his proper place in the Circle of Life. Warm, intelligent, laugh-out loud funny film is a triumph in every aspect; unforgettable songs, snappy dialogue, remarkable animation, and a stellar cast of voices make this a treat for all ages. A rousing adventure that you can enjoy again and again, and arguably one of the finest animated films ever made. ****"
"A Timeless Film","21 July 2005","10/10","Ah...""The Lion King."" There's so much I can say about this movie but all my comments always come down to one thing: this movie is beautiful. Pure genius. A timeless story. I might be a little biased in my beliefs, seeing as the first movie I remember seeing in theatres is ""The Lion King"" and I still watch it on a regular basis and know all the words but I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who agree with what I have to say. ""The Lion King"" is beautiful; hands down, it is the best Disney film ever created.The story is something that everyone can relate to, whether they are a lion ;) or not. Simba is destined to become king one day and just can't wait to rule the throne; everyone can relate to wanting to grow up and become an adult, to do whatever they want and not have to worry about anything. His father tries to teach him that, despite the fact that he will one day be grown and king, his life will not be easy. Simba has to learn his lesson the hard way when his Uncle Scar, who, too, wants the throne, kills his father and convinces Simba that it was his fault. Suddenly, growing up doesn't seem so great anymore (I can *really* relate to that).And so, Simba flees his home and comes across Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts. They teach Simba the ""Hakuna Matata"" lifestyle, something that idealizes a life free of stress, worry and responsibility. Now, don't we all wish we could live this way? No worries for the rest of our days... But when Simba's childhood friend Nala returns, he realizes that he can't live Hakuna Matata forever, for he does have a responsibility to his pride and his homeland. Simba understands that he must grow up, as we all do, and does what's right.The songs are catchy and fit the movie well (the original songs, of course, though ""The Morning Report"" isn't too bad) and the score is haunting and beautiful. Along with the art work, the music captures the heart of Africa.With the types of shows that children watch these days (boy, doesn't that make me sound old?), it's a wonder they'll learn in virtues and values at all. ""The Lion King"" is a great teacher when it comes to learning lessons that will carry throughout their lifetime. ""The Lion King"" teaches children that it's all right to be a kid but you must understand and accept responsibility for things you can and cannot control. Everyone has a place in The Circle of Life and we must find it; the film also teaches that we will encounter bad and even terrible things during our lifetime but we must accept them and move on. These are important, meaningful lessons; heck, I even used them in my SAT essay! ""The Lion King"" is a film for every generation and is a powerful film that all children should see. I'm past my childhood now and I still watch it whenever I get the chance; I look forward to sharing it with my children.A timeless film!"
"this movie is great!!","17 November 2005","9/10","I think think this film is excellent and nothing can ever relate to it. I will love this movie my whole life i know i will!! Its great :) The music, the sounds, the characters,the whole movie is great. Its definitely great for kids and it always will be this movie will never grow old. People will still like it when they are 60+. I bet there are people sixty and over who do love this movie.. I am glad that i grew up with this movie its great and i just have to say fare play to the directer i love it!!! I am happy i found this sight i think it is great it give the public a chance to see how there favorite movie is rated by people all over the world. And i think it is excellent the public is aloud to vote!"
"Its a 10","16 July 2017","10/10","""The best movie I ever watched in any form or any in language"".No, I am not exaggerating! It is the best movie ever, whether in human form or in animated. I can't find a single flaw in The Lion King (1994). Someone could argue that the story is not original, Disney just twisted it. Someone could also argue that i didn't watch that much of movies to judge ""The Best Ever"" but as I said, this the best movie I ever saw. The story is nice and free flowing and without any unnecessary bumpers. One can not recognized the voices behind the characters, because the characters are so prominent. Music! Let me say I am not very fond of English pop songs, but I could hum almost most of the songs of this movie, so I would say, music is that nice. Animation is superb, landscapes are eye catching, dialogues are sharp and comedy is at its best. What more might I say?Beside everything, you can say how crazy I am about this movie by my name. Enjoy the movie, don't leave the seat. Hakuna Matata!"
"A Modern Classic","5 June 2014","10/10","The Lion King is by general consensus the greatest Disney film from their glorious renaissance period (1989-1999), and is undoubtedly worthy of such recognition. Notably, it is the highest rated Western animation on IMDb's own Top 250, which while flawed and imprecise is a good indicator of quality.A loose adaption of Shakespeare's Hamlet, The Lion King is visually stunning, the peak of hand-drawn animation, with a strong voice cast and a wide selection of memorable tunes. It is a tight ~80 minutes, and one sometimes forgets just how quick the movie moves, yet it does so deftly. The characters are well defined, and the arc of Simba's growth, the core of the film, evolves satisfyingly. One could question whether more time should have been spent on Simba's growth in the middle act (there is incredulous imagery as Simba grows exponentially next to the stasis of Timon and Pumba), but to meander so would ask it to be an entirely different film.While it is not uncommon for a side character or two overshadow the main (see the Genie in Aladdin), Matthew Broderick and Jonathan Taylor Thomas (adult and young Simba respectively) are at risk from nearly all of the phenomenal cast. James Earl Jones is a commanding presence, and Jeremy Irons as Scar steals every scene. The 'fools' of the film, be it Timon & Pumba, the Hyena trio or even Zazu, all provide the levity believably, that would otherwise leave an incredibly sombre film. Nala is powerful, though one must note that she seems at times far more capable than Simba to actually achieve anything. Nevertheless, Simba's coming-of-age arc, while predictable, is enjoyable, helped along by fantastic charisma and choice songs.The fact that the film has spawned a wildly successful musical gives a strong indication of the quality of the music, but what is less said is how beautiful the film is. As The Lion King was being released, works were already moving away from hand-drawn animation, with Toy Story released a year later. And The Lion King might be the peak of hand-drawn, with an enormous palate of creativity and variety. The opening vista for 'Circle of Life', the bursts of colour in 'Can't wait to be King' and the sombre tone of 'Be Prepared' all are gorgeous. Yet, special mention must go to the Stampede scene, one of the finest scenes of animation ever.One thing I've developed from multiple viewings is how Timon and Pumba might be the weakest part of the movie. First, their 'life lessons' are essentially reversed by Rafiki. Certainly they are qualified to the point of being narratively sidelined. They feel contrived and even a detraction from the meat of the movie. Their role is the fast food portion of the film- the quick fix over more meatier bits of the film. The entertainment provided is enjoyable regardless, and is essential to round off the movie as Disney.The Lion King is endlessly re-watchable, catchy, fun, while remaining a fantastic piece of cinema and an invaluable part of the Disney canon. Magnificent."
"This is my sister's favourite film, and one of mine!","17 February 2009","7/10","This is a fantastic movie, and I am not lying! my 13 year old sister loves this movie, and I can't fault this either. It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so that accounts for how much I love it. The animation is superb, the backgrounds look so rich, and for once, there are no stiff movements. The highlights were the stampede and the fight between Scar and Simba. The music by Hans Zimmer is outstanding, a perfect mix of African chants and pure Hollywood. The songs are absolutely great, I had no idea that Elton John could write like that. The best song is ""Can you feel the Love Tonight?"" but the others go without fault, ""Circle of Life"" is so spirit rousing especially. Likewise with the voice overs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is very likable as Young Simba, and Matthew Broderick, while not as good, is above average too. James Earl Jones lends his booming voice to the majestic King Mufassa, and Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg provide flawless comic relief. The vocal standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar, who frightened me when I was little. Scar is up there with the best Disney villains, like Jafar, Malificent and Frollo. The humour here is fantastic, and you cry here a bit here as well. I highly recommend the stage version in the West End, and the sequels are actually two of the better DTV sequels.10/10. Bethany Cox"
"My favorite cartoon!","29 December 2023","10/10","Legendary and one of the best cartoons in history!!(and for me - the best. My mother even told me that I watched it every day as a child!)The tragic story is really instructive, beautiful landscapes and a very warm atmosphere that is memorable. The prescribed characters and the original idea - all this makes watching interesting for any age.Legendary music, beautiful animation and other things that will make you fall in love with this cartoon.It is very strange if someone has not seen this masterpiece yet. This is the classic that, although no one insists on, but it is desirable to know!"
"good movie","19 October 2015","6/10","Great movie The Lion King is a great film. Along with a great story (inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet), terrific animation, and an all star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children). Like responsibility and honor.I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen. It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget. And hopefully, you won't either. love this movie i will suggest to watch this movie you will enjoy.animals can think they also have feeling and desires they also want to live freely and happily in their own world we should not waste forest and should protect forest"
"Even after 11 Years, it's still the King.","6 June 2005","4/10","I first saw The Lion King in 1994, when I was 8 years old. Ever since then, I have seen it at least 100 times. I have seen it at least that much because I watched it once every week for almost a year and a half.Recently, I became interested in it again, after having seen The Lion King 3 (or 1,5 if you prefer). It kind of surprised me how I was still intrigued and impressed by the whole thing. It was a magical experience that was almost as good as the very first time (I hadn't seen it in years).Everything about The Lion King is so good, that I can watch it over and over again, just like in the old days. The story begins light-hearted and it has a very nice and fun atmosphere. Very stereotypical characters, as always with Disney, but ever so unique in their own way. As the story progresses, it gets very serious, dramatic and sad as well, I actually cried when I saw it the first time (hey, I was 8, give me a break).Then two of the greatest characters in the history of Disney cartoons get introduced. Timon & Pumbaa set a new height considering comedy in cartoons. Again, very stereotypical, but unique in their own way (I loved Lion King 3 because of them).Another thing I absolutely love about this is the awesome music in it. When I was young I didn't pay attention to it as much as I do now, but the music adds so much to the whole movie.It was very obvious, even from just the intro alone, that Disney worked very hard on this masterpiece. I will definitely never forget The Lion King. I still watch it occasionally and I've never been bored.That's another thing I like about this: the songs. Every major Disney picture has a few songs in it and most of the time they are very memorable. It's the same story here, the songs are very memorable and overall just brilliant. ""Circle of Life"" and ""Can't Wait to be King"" will always have a special place in my heart.I knew the entire script of the Dutch dubbed version when I was young, having seen it so many times. Kind of pathetic, I know, but I liked it that much. Still do.The King among Disney Cartoons for me."
"The Lion King review","8 August 2019","NA","The Lion King (1994) is a mixed bag for me. While the first half of the feature was well- executed, the second half somewhat felt too rushed/convenient - which kinda made it less satisfying. That being said, the songs are as always energetic and colourful. The characters are likable, Timon & Pumbaa were amusing, but all the credit goes to Scar especially, he stole the show, both as an entertainer and as a complex villain. Final verdict: It is good but it does suffer from some flaws, but for some reason people keep praising it as if it was a masterpiece. In short, I think it's overrated."
"I was a little disappointed","18 July 2016","NA","OK I know I am probably alone here, but I was a little disappointed with this film. Maybe the hype surrounding it gave me greater expectations, who knows? I thought it was a good plot, (although an overused plot in movies)and some of the characters were really good. But I found parts of the movie boring and the music not up to Disney standards. Elton John got an Oscar I believe, but can't see why.Best parts of the movie are the interactions between Simba and Scar. In fact I thought that Jeremy Irons performance was outstanding.The animation was pretty hit and miss I thought.So sorry TLK fans but I wasn't thrilled by this movie."
"So Good in So Many Ways.","3 July 2002","10/10","Outstanding animated feature from Disney that sports outstanding songs by Elton John, a compelling story and first-class animation. Young lion cub Simba is to be king, but he leaves after he believes he was the reason for his father's death (of course this is not so). As he grows up, he goes on a journey of love, friendship and discovery which will lead him back to his rightful place in the world. Excellent. 5 stars out of 5."
"A dazzling, joyous piece of film-making","9 August 2009","10/10","Of all the animation classics from the Walt Disney Company, there is perhaps none that is more celebrated than ""The Lion King."" Its acclaim is understandable: this is quite simply a glorious work of art.""The Lion King"" gets off to a fantastic start. The film's opening number, ""The Circle of Life,"" is outstanding. The song lasts for about four minutes, but from the first sound, the audience is floored. Not even National Geographic can capture something this beautiful and dramatic. Not only is this easily the greatest moment in film animation, this is one of the greatest sequences in film history.The story that follows is not as majestic, but the film has to tell a story. Actually, the rest of the film holds up quite well. The story takes place in Africa, where the lions rule. Their king, Mufasa (James Earl Jones) has just been blessed with a son, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), who goes in front of his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) as next in line for the throne. Scar is furious, and sets in motion plans to usurp the throne for himself. After a tragedy occurs and Mufasa is killed, Scar persuades Simba to flee, leaving himself as king. Simba grows up in exile, but he learns that while he can run away from his past, he can never escape it.When viewing the film, it is obvious that ""The Lion King"" is quite different from its predecessors (and successors). This is an epic story that contains more dramatic power than all the other Disney films combined. While there are definitely some light-hearted moments, there is no denying the dark drama that takes up the bulk of the story. While it could be argued that Disney is the champion of family entertainment, this film is not for the very young. Some of the sequences are very dark and violent, many bordering on frightening, even for the older crowd.The voice actors are terrific. Jonathan Taylor Thomas brings a large dose of innocence to Young Simba. He's mischievous, but also terribly naive. His older counterpart, voiced by Matthew Broderick, equals him. He's older, but no less mature. The voices are so similar that it's almost impossible not to believe that they are the same character at different ages. Perhaps no one could have been better suited for the role of Mufasa than James Earl Jones. His baritone voice gives the Mufasa a quality of great power and wisdom; there is no question that his role is king. As Scar, Jeremy Irons is pitch-perfect. The drawing of the character is villainous, but Irons' vocal work complements the animation to create one of the most memorable, and vicious, villains in Disney history. He's unquestionably evil, but he's also clever, which makes him all the more dangerous. Manipulation, not violence is his greatest weapon. Providing some much needed comic relief are Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts (a meerkat and a warthog), and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. While there is definite fun from these characters, neither the actors nor the filmmakers allow them to go over-the-top and destroy the mood of the film.Disney's animated features are known for their gorgeous artwork. Nowhere is this more apparent than in ""The Lion King."" Every single frame is jaw-dropping. The colors are rich, and the drawings are sharp and beautiful. One of the pitfalls of animation (both computer and hand-drawn) is that there is sometimes a visible distance between the subject and the background, making it seem as if the figure animation was cut and pasted on the background (this is obviously what happens, but it is up to the artists to make sure that it isn't noticeable). There is none of that here.Throughout the Golden Age of Disney animation, the films have been musicals. ""The Lion King"" is no different, and the songs are brilliant. All of the numbers are standouts (""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" won the Oscar, but in my opinion, ""The Circle of Life"" was better). In the cases of Simba and Nala (Simba's girlfriend), both young and old, there is a noticeable difference between the speaking and singing parts (everyone else does their own singing and speaking), but never mind. It still works, and that's what's important.""The Lion King"" is not flawless, but on first viewing, they aren't noticeable, and it is likely that the young won't ever notice them. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was the first animated film to get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (it lost to ""The Silence of the Lambs""), and is thus far the only animated film to receive such an honor. That being the case, it's hard to understand why ""The Lion King"" was not given the same distinction. The two films are more or less equal in quality, and the nominees for the honor that year were not strong.If you haven't already, see ""The Lion King."" You won't be disappointed."
"One of the greatest animated movies Ever made","4 September 2021","10/10","My favorite animated film of all time. The plot, characters, themes, music, emotions and tension are something else. It's truly a classic you will love as a kid and appreciate years later as an adult. A must watch."
"They don't make movies like that anymore","8 September 2013","9/10","That was the first movie I've ever watched in a cinema. I was a kid and I remember crying while watching - I was in love with the characters and I was feeling them. They felt so real to me. Now... actually, as a grown person, now is the same. Characters are so believable and so realistic. Watching the movie as an adult brings a whole new meaning. The good and the bad characters from the movie are like the people I meet everyday in real life. The story is full of morals which I think are really important for young kids these days. I think that The Lion King is a must for every child and adult! With it's characters and plot, it can really move you and the kids might actually learn something from it. It is far better than modern cartoons full of meaningless action and dialogue."
"Wonderful Music and Rhythms","28 March 2006","10/10","This is an outstanding work of animation. I realize that it has been criticized for political incorrectness. The fact of the matter is that it has strong female characters as well as male, and it's about a vision of monarchy. I have the greatest respect for female role models but I really don't see this as a worthy criticism. It's a great story of defeat and betrayal and renewal. It has delightful individual characters, dressed up to show their beings in a clever way. It has the most despicable villains with Scar and the Hyenas. It has the Henry II thing about duty. It doesn't glorify fooling around as one of my colleagues told me. The free life is OK but at some time you must follow your heart and redeem yourself. The music is outstanding; another triumph or the Disney team. There are three or four numbers that are so critical to a complete understanding of the events of the story. The sound effects person should have been rewarded because sound is so critical in this. From the stampede to the forbidden areas of the kingdom. I watched this about sixty times with my small children and never really tired of it. I would put this at the top of any list of animated adventures."
"My favorite cartoon from Disney!","16 November 2005","6/10","The Lion King is a classic from Disney. I remember going to the movie theater/cinema and watching the film...I was exactly 8 years old. And until now, with 19 years old, the good sensation of watching this movie is the same as that time. My mother even bought me Simba's doll! =)The story takes place in Africa, where Simba, son of Mufasa, is very well protected by his dad.(sometimes with the help of Zazu, a bird that is kind of a counselor of the king Mufasa)Everything goes well, but there is one problem: Scar, Mufasa's brother, is jealous because he is not the king of the jungle, and decides to do a plan to kill Simba and Mufasa. Simba escapes, but Mufasa dies; Scar tells Simba that he is guilty for Mufasa's death,and the terrified Simba runs away, too sad of what happened. Far from his kingdom, Simba meets Pumbaa and Timon, who takes care of him and teaches about Hakuna's Matata philosophy. Everything will be very well for a long time, until Simba meet again his childhood friend Nala ,who tells him about the horrible things Scar is doing in the old Kingdom."
"great songs in Shakespearian epic","15 May 2015","10/10","King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi have a new son Simba. Mufasa's younger brother Scar is jealous of the new heir to the throne to rule the African plains. Scar tricks Simba to go to the elephant graveyard. Simba takes Nala despite Zazu's warnings. They are set upon by hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. Mufasa rescues them. Scar comes up with a scheme to kill Mufasa and Simba. Scar places Simba in the middle of a wildebeest stampede herded by the hyenas. Scar kills Mufasa while he's rescuing his son. The hyenas chase Simba away. Scar claims the throne with Simba assumed to be dead. Meerkat Timon and warthog Pumbaa befriends the lost Simba and teach him their motto ""hakuna matata"".Simba is an annoying brat. He's my main problem in this movie because he annoys me even as a self-obsessed cub. It is the point of the movie so I do have to overlook it somewhat. I just don't care enough about Simba. Although, I don't know how I would feel about an animated Hamlet. The songs are iconic. The drama is Shakespearian. There is a lot to like about this classic but not necessarily Simba."
"'....There's one in every family...' Disney magic.","21 June 2023","7/10","Animal rivalries spiral out of control as The King's heir pushes the original successor to challenge for the crown.I vowed to watch more Disney films, and tonight's random choice was The Lion King, regarded by many as the greatest of all, and I can understand why, the story is brilliant, the music is superb and the animation holds up nicely. It's a good old fashioned Disney story of good and evil.Young and old will love this film, I love it so much that I saw the stage play, the live action film and a re release a few years back. Seeing this on the big screen was worth it, the landscapes were breathtaking.I had preconceived ideas that this film won a host of Oscars, when I checked it out, I noticed it won two, both for the music, I'm a little surprised. The music is tremendous, Hans Zimmer and Elton John, what better mix could anyone wish for?The humorous moments are sublime, Zazu is hilarious, Rowan Atkinson is an absolute joy, so sarcastic, so funny. Whoopi Goldberg is also perfect as Shenzi, again so funny.The voices fit each and every character, James Earl Jones and Matthew Broderick shone, it wouldn't have worked without Jeremy Irons, what a talent.This film cannot be given any other score than....10/10."
"Would you believe its dated!","12 October 2006","3/10","The Lion King made a big splash when it was released in the mid-90's. I missed it then, but saw it recently because of my 3 yr old son. I've also seen other animated-family comedies like Shrek, Finding Nemo and Ice Age in recent weeks. Given the leaps in digital technology achieved in the past decade, The Lion King looks very dated. The animation and colors are not as realistic and vivid as 21st century Pixar-Disney offerings.This is basically a child-friendly take on the Hamlet tale with Denmark replaced by the African jungle and people replaced by lions, and other animals, notably a parrot, hyenas etc. The Elton John soundtrack is still quite good, with The Morning Report and Hakuna Matata standing out. The dialogue is not nearly as witty as that of Ice Age or Nemo but still appealing for kids. We have James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons voices for two vital characters, and both have magnificent voices for animated movies. Irons even sings a song or two and has a pretty pleasant voice."
"Very overrated","26 December 2009","9/10","I find many people describe this film with extreme fondness. I watched it again today after not watching it since I was a child, maybe a little over ten years ago. I really cannot believe the big fuss and when I read reviews on here to see what everyone loved about it I couldn't really find anything and to be honest it just seemed that everyone was stating the obvious 'the songs,' which were the only terrific thing about the entire film, and the fact that they 'loved it as a child,' but children love what everyone else loves, can you really point out something that can really be admired? Do people not consider the incoherence of the plot? I have seen many reviewers see the film as I do, and they tend to point out the things that people don't seem to realise, such as the extremely annoying characters and the fact that the characters are almost... scrambled-like throughout. It's hardly a story. And I know you could say well maybe I liked it as a child because it is a child's film but as many people have stated it is not - because of the violence and depression. What irritated me most is how the film makes you feel sad at the death of Simba's father, yet Simba himself just runs away and almost immediately seems to feel indifferent towards the situation! He just DOESN'T care! He starts singing hakuna matata for goodness sake!!I struggle to see why this film is so loved."
"The Lion King","11 February 2020","10/10","A film that only get better with repeat viewings and age, The Lion King is a fantastic animated masterpiece that is among Disney's finest achievements. Stellar voice work, great musical score, beautiful to look at and emotionally complex and riveting."
"Even better than 'Frozen'","5 November 2015","8/10","My favourite Disney movie of all time. I watched this again recently with my young children and I was just as gripped as when I watched it as a child myself.I found myself singing the songs with my daughter afterwards.The animation is truly wonderful. Although this film is 20 years old I'm not sure they could have made it any more impressive today. The full majesty of Africa, the terror and exhilaration of the wildebeest stampede, the colours and the sounds - it's exhilarating.The story is a fairly typical Disney one of a kid who loses his way before remembering what it means to have responsibility. But that's fine by me.This is a movie to make you feel good and re-live a child-like sense of awe and wonder."
"Made a special person's day better","23 December 2011","10/10","This movie will never get old, no matter how many times we watch it and no matter how old we are. Today it made a dear friend of mine's day better. So, if this movie wasn't made, my friend would be having a sad day, but thanks to the people who made this movie happen, my friend is all good now, and I love anyone who makes my baby girl's day better. When a movie manages to cheer up a person more than 10 years after it was made, then it proves to everyone that it was one successful movie. If you're having a sad day, maybe you should watch this movie. If a friend is having a sad day, maybe you should suggest this movie to them."
"Best animated Disney movie!","22 September 2013","10/10","This is my favourite animated Disney movie ever. It has a good plot, good storyline, good characters and good villains. This movie is a must see for any kid and I'm sure a lot of adults enjoy this movie too. Basically its about a lion cub simba who is future king of the pride lands but his uncle scar wants to be king and so forms a plot to kill simba he doesn't succeed in killing simba but instead kills simbas father. Scar convinces simba that it is his fault his father died to simba feeling upset and guilty runs away. Some scenes are funny and some are sad. This is a movie I could watch over and over simply because its a great movie as I have already said a must see for anyone especially Disney fans. I give this movie an 8 out of 10"
"The True Classic Disney Movie!","18 September 2011","10/10","This may be an unorthodox way to start a review, but hey it's as meaningful as i'll ever be for a review. My lucky number is 14. I was born on August 14th. My birth sign is Leo (Lion), my State Football Team is the Lions, and its been 14 years since i'v seen my favorite movie from my childhood; The Lion King for the first time. And now I had the honor to experience it in the theater. From the moment the black screen faded to the rising sun along on the African Plane, with opening Zulu lyrics playing to Circle of Life, I got chills up my spine and my lips were shaking as they were forming the biggest smile I think i'v ever had. Now of all the films to come out these past years like the final Harry Potter, Avatar, Inception, Super 8, Transformers, etc. I want make this clear; The Lion King was the funnest time i'v ever had at the Movies! I don't even care for it being part of the 3D effect.I wanted to see it in the theater as if it was the opening weekend back in 1994. It's still The Lion King, but in a sentimental way (If your a 90's kid) it makes you completely feel dropped back into your seat like it's was the first time viewing it. The story of a young lion prince, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Matthew Broderick) framed into killing his father Mufasa (James Earl Jones) by his evil uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons). Then flees from his past and meets Timon (Nathan Lane) and Pumba (Ernie Sabella) whom teach him ""Hakuna Matata"" (Literally meaning No Worries). And in the end Simba returns to be the one true king. The story may be considered Hamlet with lions, but it's so much more than that. Most in part of the fun characters, humor, and still having the true drama and emotion that makes The Lion King what it is. The 3D added depth to the film and actually didn't give me a headache. Zazu flying overhead Pride Rock, the music sequences, and the stampede scene are better than ever, yet I'm sure the new generation seeing it will probably be emotionally scarred for life. I don't want to be a ""Lion King is the Best Disney Movie Ever"" Guy without mentioning it has a flaw. Which is its quick resolve with the last 40 minutes of the movie. Yeah, Simba is intervened by his old childhood friend Nala and crazy shaman blue butt monkey Rafiki to go back home from his 'time away from home' that almost feels like the 10 second log scene in Hakuna Matata. In any way it still doesn't turn you away. Then add the key ingredient to a classic Disney Movie; Songs! Just another element that adds to the formula. Elton John and Tim Rice won an Oscar for their work on this film! And who's to say they don't deserve it? Circle of Life, Just Can't Wait to be King, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, Can You Feel the Love Tonight, and even Timons Hula Song! It took every bone in my body not to sing in the theater but hey, now there's another reason for multiple viewings. I want to say to those who are curious, there is no ""Morning Report"" song in the film! Disneys Classic 2D Animated films are true Disney.Disney mixed meaningful and powerful themes with maximum entertainment in a perfect way that are what make true classics. Today any critic from the New York Times can slap a comment on a movie saying it's a ""classic"" when really they can't say in 10 years people will be talking about it. But hey, Hakuna Matata! In the end if you want a luxury of seeing (Arguably) Disneys best film on the big screen than don't hold back. It will really make you feel like a kid for an hour and a half, and also give you witness to Disneys most beautiful masterpiece that isn't just Dinsey's Best, but possibly one of the greatest achievements ever made.....The Lion King!"
"The pinnacle of animated movies.","27 September 1998","6/10","The Lion King is absolutely Disney's greatest achievement to date and will long be hailed as such. The story is classic, but better yet are both the stunning animation and the inspirational score by Hans Zimmer. The songs are brilliantly written with music by Elton John (with help from Zimmer) and Lyrics by Andrew Lloyd Webber's long-time partner, Tim Rice. If you aren't among the millions that have purchased the video DO IT (if you can find it anywhere)!"
"A milestone in cartoon story-telling.","20 January 2012","8/10","I believe that a great movie is one that clearly conveys a strong message. One that you can use to justify your views on various topics. Only a hand full of movies delivered the aforementioned attribute as well as The Lion King. Although this film's plot is enough to prove its brilliance, factors like voice-acting, background themes, dialogs, etc give an attentive viewer more to be impressed with. Case in point: James Earl Jones's voice boosted Mufasa's powerful appearance. The voice had a commanding tone which rivaled Mufasa's powerful roar. Likewise, there are many details that can make this movie the face of Disney. It has been more than 10 years since its release, and it still boasts a strong stance against far more graphically advanced movies. Kids as well as adults can enjoy this flick, possibly without snacks. I rate this film a ten out of ten while suggesting that everyone watch it at least once."
"Not Disney's best movie, I ought to tell you","22 December 2012","7/10","So I didn't give this movie 10 stars, are you fans all mad at me? Anyway, this movie is often a fan favourite of many of my friends. Ever since one of my classmates in English class began singing Hakuna Matata, often to annoy me, I have been analyzing this movie and trying hard not to make any fan of this movie mad at me.But I'm getting sidetracked. While the animation (and artwork in general) is astounding and clearly had a lot of effort put in, I find that the story seems to have not as much effort put in.Based on the Shakespeare play Hamlet (and Kimba the White Lion, but I'll get to that later), this film revolves around a lion who, after losing his father to his envious uncle Scar, is convinced to remember his past and that HE should rightfully claim the throne. I like the message that the past can hurt and you can run from it or learn from it, but I feel a lot doesn't work for me.For example, the plot (as I mentioned before) is derived from two great works of fiction. It wouldn't bother me as much if the end credits said ""Based on Hamlet by William Shakespeare and Kimba the White Lion by Osamu Tezuka"" or if Disney didn't tout it as an original story.Then there's one of my biggest issues with this movie, this movie doesn't know if it wants to be for younger children (3-6) or older children (7-12). While it does deal with mature subjects such as the death of a loved one, responsibility, handling guilt etc, there's too much other stuff in this movie that's immature.It goes without saying that when a protagonist experiences a tragic turn of events, the first thing we want is something that will cheer us up afterwards... for many, Hakuna Matata comes to mind, but... for me, I think there could have been a better way of accomplishing that.Speaking of which, I find only three of the songs from this movie worth listening to, Circle of Life (kudos to Hans Zimmer), Be Prepared (who doesn't admire a song as awesome as this?) and the end credits version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight? (Gotta listen to more Elton John, though). As you might have guessed, Hakuna Matata, while it may have appealed to me some 6-7 years earlier, is now the song I hate the most from this movie. It just blows my mind that a movie like this goes from a lion cub witnessing the murder of his father by a jealous uncle to one of the most annoying and whimsical songs I have ever heard as well as belching and flatulence jokes... see what I mean when I say it's not very clear on the audience it wants to appeal to? I am in disbelief that the guy who wrote songs for Princess Diana's funeral actually wrote a song as annoying as that.Also, there are scenes in this movie that are too intense for younger children, such as the death of Mufasa, the hyena chasing Simba and Nala, Simba and Nala (grown up, and before they recognize each other) fighting and the climax. I would strongly recommend waiting until your kids are 6 or 7 years old, or if they understand how hard it is to handle the death of a loved one.But what I really like about this movie is the father-and-son connection between Simba and Mufasa, which is one of the reasons why you're supposed to find it sad when Mufasa dies, just like why we're supposed to sympathize with Bambi when his mother dies. Whenever you watch Mufasa and Simba conversing happily, you just know there's a connection between the two.Overall, this movie is not bad, but not everything is flawless, and this is no exception. For any fan seething with anger at this review, I see some good stuff in this movie!"
"Exciting original story from Disney.","1 November 2013","3/10","This movie's story was written solely by Disney Studios, about a young lion, Simba, who was forced into exile by his evil Uncle Scar, who wants to take control of the jungle before Simba claims it. Life in the jungle declines under Scar's rule as Simba abandons his identity and meets new friends, Timon and Pumbaa, in another part of the jungle.Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff directed an exciting movie, adopting more of what I think are some of mainstream Hollywood's intense drama and comedy styles, seen in such parts like Uncle Scar and his crafty hyena goons chasing away poor Simba like gangsters pursuing a helpless hero, and the parts of the more modern day jokes and punchlines made by Timon and Pumbaa. The movie is also full of drama and action that will attract an audience of all ages, providing a great source of entertainment. It is compelling to see how Simba tries to wrestle his way out of his doubts as he tries to find his true identity and compelling to see Simba's family try to overcome adversary under Scar's rule. This is also a powerful story about courage, duty and identity (noticable as Simba tries to find his way) and the importance of family. Hans Zimmer did a good job on the music score and Elton John wrote some memorable songs like ""Circle of Life"" and ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight."" The toe-tapping ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"" is my favorite.The characters are likable and, like the plot's style, take on more of a mainstream Hollywood approach. This movie differs from the more earlier films such as ""Cinderella"" and ""The Jungle Book,"" and even the later films such as ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast."" ""The Lion King"" doesn't have that Disney touch you've come to expect and love in many of the fairytale and adventure movies, signaling that Disney films have evolved immensely over time. Even though it's not one of the more conventional Disney films, ""The Lion King"" is still a very good movie to watch due to its original concept, captivating story and memorable characters.Grade B+"
"A classic, but..","8 March 2017","9/10","One can't argue, that ""The Lion King"" is one of those movies people expect you to know when the conversation comes to films. After years of missed chances I finally managed to close this hole. Of course, as far as I can tell, I'm not exactly the peer group for this title, so I won't be judging too hard.The movie tells a nice story. One of those typical stories of good and evil, betrayal and loyalty and the difficulties of finding yourself. Wouldn't it be for the animals, it could as well be some historical drama. Whilest you don't get bored, partly due to the humorous sidekicks, the plot in itself is not really all to innovative.The big strength of the film is in my eyes the soundtrack, that produced quite a few classics that even I could recall. Singing in movies is always a risky thing but in this case reminds me of the old day Disney movies, where singing was almost something like a brand mark.""The Lion King"" is short, but I'm sure children will be able to fall in love with the exceptionally drawn characters quite easily and therefor have their fun. Personally, I didn't quite see why this particular title has so much more credit than many other comparable movies but it entertained me well for an evening."
"Clichéd story and passive central character make for a weak Disney entry","10 October 2014","10/10","Unlike the majority of its Walt Disney brethren, The Lion King was written directly for the screen and does not find its roots in either a fairy tale or popular children's literature. It relates the story of the young lion Simba, who is destined to become king of the pride one day when his regal father Mufasa steps down. This does not sit well with Mufasa's villainous brother Scar, who concocts a scheme to eliminate Mufasa and then convince a guilt-stricken Simba that the death is his own fault and he should exile himself from the pride. Simba befriends the unlikely duo of a meercat and warthog and they become friends during his exile, until his childhood friend Nala arrives to apprise Simba of the ruin that Scar's villainy has left the pride and beg for Simba's return.Although the plot is fairly familiar and clichéd for a new story, there is a lot that could be done here. Unfortunately, Simba is such a passive, uninteresting central character that it is difficult to care much about what happens. Other than Simba, Mufasa and Scar, the pride pretty much blurs together. Simba's mother is a virtual non-entity and Simba's female friend Nala is gone for so much of the running time that you nearly forget she is a character in the film. Other than the comical meercat and warthog team (well voiced by Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella), none of the supporting characters are especially memorable, and that duo has little to no impact on the climax. It also does not help that Scar (lazily voiced by Jeremy Irons) is a fairly dull villain. His first act number where he sings about his nefarious plans is disturbing, not only because of Irons horrendous singing, but because someone had the ill-conceived notion of having hordes of his hyena henchmen goose-stepping in the background like Nazi soldiers, which adds a heavy weight that this slight film cannot carry. The film also has a fair amount of dead spots between songs and fight scenes.The animation is typically first-rate, but not as impressive or imaginative as that found in its predecessors, even as recent as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. The vocal talent is a mixed bag as well. While Lane and Sabella are stand-outs and James Earl Jones provides the suitably dignified tones for Mufasa, Matthew Broderick is an incredibly bland choice to voice the adult Simba. Ditto, Moira Kelly is not much better as Nala. Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin are not particularly menacing as some of the hyenas.Huge gaps in the story seem to smack of really lazy writing. Mufasa is supposed to be an insightful leader, yet is completely blind-sided by the evil plots of his nasty brother, whose perfidy is ridiculously blatant. Once Scar is king and demonstrates that he is terrible, the film would have us believe that not only are there no other male lions to challenge him, but that the lionesses would passively put up with him destroying the pride without any show of resistance. This, of course, sets up the scene for Simba to return as a savior and rescue the pride while facing down Scar, but there are several things wrong. First, the film never convinces us that there is a need for anyone to await Simba's return when the pride could have banded together themselves to challenge Scar and his minions instead of suffering. And second, Simba does nothing during the course of the film to demonstrate that he could be anyone's savior other than that he is Mufasa's son and the plot rather ham-handedly demands it of him.I am also not a fan of the soundtrack written by Elton John. The film opens with the ""The Circle of Life,"" which is a sequence that heralds the birth of Simba, introduces the main characters and sets the stage. Unfortunately, I find this song comes off like one of the worst examples of faux-inspirational Christian rock. ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" sung by the young Simba feels like a third-rate Michael Jackson riff. ""Hakuna Matata"" is probably the best of the songs, but it is surprisingly forgettable. And the less said about the dirge-like love ballad ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"", the better. It is a horrible song badly shoe-horned into the film. Old childhood friends Simba and Nala rediscover each other and then immediately start fighting, then the film pauses for the love ballad, before they go back to fighting and parting. It is a clumsily staged sequence and one that more often than not has the little ones tuning out. Ironically, the song that sticks with the viewer after the film ends is ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"", the old 1950s nutshell which gets a few bars sung in the film and easily outclasses John's pretentious and precious piffles.Purportedly this is Walt Disney's biggest box office success, but it is hard to understand why or how given some of the landmark classics in animation that Disney has provided in the past. I don't find the film fun, or memorable, or particularly astonishing. In fact, barring the dreadful Hercules, I would rank this as one of the worst of the Disney films."
"You Are More Than What You Have Become","15 June 2014","10/10","So...I'm going to try not to be too biased here...I'm going to compose myself the best I can...But, I'm not going to lie, that's going to be really hard seeing as though I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE!!! I know a lot of people say this film is overrated and all that jazz, but LOOK AT THIS FILM and tell me you don't love it too!ANIMATION: Spectacular! This movie looks great! Of course it has an epic, grand quality about it, and the animation really takes it to another level! The stampede scene has got to be one of the biggest scenes ever put to traditional animation!SONGS/MUSIC: This movie brings us the Tim Rice/Elton John team. Even though there's no Alan Menken or Howard Ashman, these songs are still great! They fit the movie's tone, they're not out of place, and they are ALL memorable! This Disney movie has the best soundtrack - there is no Number One hit song from this film - ALL the songs are Number One! I don't just love the songs, but I am in mad love with Hans Zimmer's score! It's beautiful! It tells the story and fits the mood perfectly! The main theme, ""Lea Halalela,"" is fan-frickin-tastic! Gosh, if that theme were a woman, I'd marry her! But the music is what takes us to Africa (which country are we in? I don't know...), and if it weren't for Lebo M's contributions, NO music in this movie would be great!ROMANCE: For as much as I love this movie, I have to admit that this is one of the weak aspects of the film. I love the ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" number; I love the song, and I love looking at the animation. But...why is the song here? Why is this scene here? First of all, it doesn't match the story at all. It feels like the scene takes place because...Disney movies have romance scenes! Secondly, I don't believe Simba and Nala are in love. Look at how other Disney films show love: characters are smiling, singing, happy, and would do anything to be with their romantic interest. Here, Simba and Nala are arguing and yelling at each other after the scene. I'll tell you what, though, if you look at Nala as she's laying on her back during the song number, look at how she looks at Simba. That says, ""I want you, lion man.""CHARACTERS: I am in love with these characters! Much like the ""Beauty and the Beast"" gang, there's not a person...or animal...in this movie I don't dislike! My two favorite characters are Mufasa and Rafiki. Mufasa wreaks of power! The reason we hate Scar so much is because he kills Mufasa, who we love so much! He is the father of Disney movie fathers - Disney fathers period! He says one of my favorite lines: ""Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become."" OOOH, that line just OOZES power - just BLEEDS power!!! Rafiki is awesome because he is both funny and wise. He knows just what to say and just what to do for the right moment. He has funny lines like ""It means you are a baboon, and I am not!"" Yet he knows when to hit Simba over the head with a stick and tell him to learn from his mistakes. Go Rafiki!STORY: I think the story is excellent. I love watching it, I love watching Simba's arc, I think it is brilliant...Though, there's one other problem the movie has that lies in the story. After Mufasa dies and Simba cries over his body, Scar comes and tells him to run away. Question: if they're all alone, why doesn't Scar just kill Simba himself? At first I thought it was because he didn't want Simba's blood on his hands, but that can't be right. First of all, he has Mufasa's blood on his hands. Second of all, he has a violent fight with Simba at the end of the movie. If Scar wants the throne so badly that he puts together an attack against two children, a Nazi team of hyenas, and a wildebeest stampede, I don't think he was above killing a child. The movie could have been over just like that; why didn't he kill Simba? The only reason I can come up with is ""If he killed him, there'd be no movie."" Well, that's weak. If that's the case, then the movie didn't need to happen. We should have gotten a better reason for the following events that took place.CONCLUSION: Despite the two problems I have with the movie, I still adore it! It's epic, it's dramatic, it's funny, it's musical! It is large! It has one of the saddest moments ever in Disney. It is one of the studio's biggest movies for a reason! Find out for yourself in the big Circle of Life! BOOYIKA!"
"The Greatest Disney Film Ever Made","15 September 2011","9/10","This is the most incredible movie I have ever seen. Sounds silly? It may, considering it is an animated film which a majority of people don't take seriously when in the subject of the greatest movies anyone has ever seen. I personally love animated anything, whether it be cartoons, movies, shorts, etc. The Lion King *IS* the king of all Disney films. We all know the tragic tale of the death of Simba's father, even if we had not seen the movie, thus recognition and praise this movie receives absolutely deserves it no less. This is my favourite movie. The art is simply fantastic. The animation is just breathtaking. The story -- though based off of 'Hamlet' -- is beautiful and will leave you in tears. The voice actors and actresses did an impeccable job for each of the characters' personalities. I especially adore the music. The Lion King had introduced me to African music and I have loved it ever since. The songs in the movie such as ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" (one sung by Elton John, and one sung by Kristle Edwards along with the voices of adult Simba and Nala, both pieces of which I love and listen to everyday) and ""Hakuna Matata"" are divine and catchy, not to mention adorable. I cannot say how much I love this film. I'm in love with it. The producers and directors and every person who had contributed to the making of it did a marvelous job. Overall, this movie is PERFECT. I've watched it a hundred times already and I'll watch it a hundred more without feeling the slightest bit sick of it."
"A movie to be watched by every Animator","19 August 2017","NA","I being an Animator watched this movie over and over. The quality of animation, movement and voices behind the characters all were so good I have this movie in my collection.This movie was the best animated movie for me in 1994, but still is. The creativity in screenplay, dialog, character development, environment, music, etc. all are masterpieces. This movie is outstanding and exceptional for me."
"An emotional masterpiece for all ages","27 November 2011","NA","Directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, The Lion King (1994) is a Disney masterpiece. It provides a colorful and multi-emotional experience while subtly delivering an important life message, enjoyable for people of all ages. Not many films are so enveloping as to successfully simultaneously deliver an action-packed adventure, romance, and comedy. Throughout the entire film, the audience is entranced by the wondrous diegesis that is created, and so easily mourns when it is supposed to mourn and laughs when it is supposed to laugh. The Lion King uses animals as opposed to humans (as in Shakespeare's Hamlet), but this contributes to the experience and message rather than takes away from them. Under all the emotion, this charming film makes a social statement, that the circle of life must inevitably continue, and death should be accepted as long it is part of the natural cycle. As a perfect mix of an emotional experience and a moral message, it's no wonder that The Lion King raked in so much revenue and is seen as one of the best films in Disney history.In many parts of the narrative, the audience is completely wrapped up by the magical atmosphere that the film creates, with help from its beautiful original score. In the scene where Mufasa dies, the audience follows Simba, both visually and emotionally, through the discovery of his father's limp body and the acceptance of his passing away. The audience feels the fear and desperation of the little Simba cub as he sees Mufasa motionless on the floor. The audience weeps for Simba as he tries to ""wake up"" his father. Later in the film, when adult Simba meets Nala, the musical accompaniment, ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" (composed by Elton John) (1994), really creates the romantic mood that devours the audience's heart. When Timon and Pumbaa break the audience out of that oneiric state with their funny antics, and even when they break the fourth wall, they offer a reprieve from the intense emotion present in the rest of the film. These reprieves strengthen the emotions created rather than diminish them. They are an asset to the deep emotions awakened by The Lion King.The use of lions instead of humans might be expected to reduce the emotional intensity of the film, but instead it actually, in some ways, increases it. With animals, the audience experiences defamilarization, as the death of a lion, although still sad, is less taboo and tragic than a death of human. If human Scar had murdered human Mufasa, the audience would experience boundless hate for Scar, rather than experiencing the sadness of Simba as it was supposed to. Using animals also made the diegesis much more colorful and kid-friendly. Using human characters would have created a whole other unwanted experience.Aside from the emotional aspect of the film, The Lion King also disguises a powerful social statement. At the end of the film, the child of Simba and Nala is declared the heir of the pride, as Simba was at the beginning of the film. This metaphorically completes ""The Circle of Life"" (also composed by Elton John) (1994), the title of the opening score. The audience learns that Mufasa's death was inevitable, and sooner or later Simba will die too. Death must happen to complete the cycle, and the past should not be clung on to. This important message is what makes The Lion King more than a simple narrative and a delight for 5-year-olds and 50-year-olds alike.The Lion King was made 17 years ago, yet still stands as an artful classic, despite it being an animation movie. This is a result of the intense emotional experience that an audience can't help but be enveloped by, and a powerful life lesson that is delivered flawlessly. Throughout the action, romance, and sudden comedy, the audience follows without any difficulty at all, and at the end, learns a valuable lesson. The choice to use animals also benefited the film. Aside from making the film more kid-friendly, it precisely manipulated the audience's feelings. The Lion King is a shining gem in film history, a gem that will truly stand the test of time.The Lion King will remain one of my favorite films for a long time, and if you haven't seen it yet, you definitely should."
"Favourite Disney classic","2 March 2012","9/10","To begin with: this movie is worth watching just for the music. The beginning (also optically beautiful) still gives me goosebumps. If anyone ever deserved the Oscar, it was the two guys who got it for this one! Though it's wonderful entertainment, the film also contains some serious topics, like death, taking responsibility and coping with the past. The characters are charming, the romance between Simba and Nala is really cute, and the song lyrics are worth listening twice.A little warning to parents: as I said, this is a perfect Disney classic and really recommendable to both adults and children - only not for very young ones. The scene of Mufasa's death is very sad and touching, and Scar's and Simba's fight at the end could be considered scary."
"Disneys best","28 February 2008","10/10","The lion king is one of my favourite movies of all time. It is possibly Disney's best movie and is one that any person of any age group will adore. My dad worked for Disney's video department and he got all the great Disney movies and of all of them the lion king is perhaps the best along with Aladdin and toy story. It has the worst Disney villain in the form of scar, has a truly touching story which captivates the watcher and has some of the best Disney characters to date. It won 2 Oscars one of them for best original song in the shape of ""can you feel the love tonight"". Personally i much prefferd and thought that ""the circle of life"" ""I just cant wait to be king"" or ""Hakuna Matata"". This is possibly the last great hand drawn Disney movie as well as toy story followed up a couple of years later. Truly a delight to watch and one of the best movies ever made.You have got to watch it."
"A Question of Values","4 May 2005","7/10","While I don't deny that 'The Lion King'is well animated and has a terrific score, I believe it principally a capitalist parable. Recall the scene where Mufasa walks with Simba through the plains and explains the 'natural order of things'--where the strong prey upon the weak to maintain overall balance and perfection. ""We eat the antelope, the antelope eat the grass, etc."" (trickle-down effect?) And that thrilling opening scene, where all of the animals gather to witness Simba's birth. Isn't there something a little twisted about a bunch of zebras and antelopes gathering to bray joyously about the birth of yet another lion? The lions are the heroes, and we're lead to believe that the establishment rules with an even paw. The underdogs (hyenas) are villains, and when they challenge the established order, the result is chaos and decay. Simba's decision to live the hakuna matata philosophy throws the kingdom's delicate balance out of whack. Only when power returns to the son of the old king is the land restored. The messages? Don't question the established order. It is natural and fair for the strong to take down the weak. Do your job, fulfill your function. It's best if power stays in the same hands for generation after generation. Now, this may be all well and good in the actual ecosystem of the savanna or whatever, but Disney's whole gimmick is to blur the line between animal and human, and give animals human characteristics and values. Don't underestimate the power of these messages--children obsess over animated characters. I remember as a child fighting with my friends over who would get to play 'Cinderella' in our make-believe game. Merchandise (dolls, toys, halloween costumes, spin off books, amusement parks) reinforces the message, serving as a constant reminder. So it's simply a question of what values you want your children to absorb. If they include: social darwinism, unquestioning defense of the status quo, and contempt for the underdog, this is the film for you. Otherwise, I would stick to muppets."
"Very good","11 November 2018","10/10","We enjoyed this film immensely. Great voices for the characters, including a compelling villain. Loosely follows the story of Shakespeare's Hamlet."
"The Lion King roars on!","7 April 2011","6/10","I first heard of this wonderful Disney feature when I popped in the Aladdin tape, and I knew it was going to be my favorite. A year later, I saw it in a theatre as a double feature paired with Angels in the Outfield. It was so good I did not want to see it come to an end. I begged to see it again and I got my chance at a library and it was just as mesmerizing. I finally got it on video and to this day it never fails to impress. With gorgeous animation, memorable characters, unbelievable score, and a well thought out story with a great message for anyone of any age (""We are all connected in the the great circle of life"", said Mufasa), what's not to like? My favorite song is Hakuna Matata (of course!) but I have many of these songs stuck in my head from time to time. To top it all off, I recently saw the Broadway musical and you owe it to yourself to see it.Hakuna Matata!"
"Hamlet in disguise","18 June 2018","4/10","As most people probably know by now, this is a ripoff of Shakespeare's story Hamlet. I don't really like the movie, but I cannot say that it doesn't have it's moments where it is good. The songs are memorable and it makes a classic play's plot easy to follow but changes the ending to where it's happy and kid friendly. Definitely worth at least watching it once and showing it to your kids when they're old enough to enjoy it but not understand the entire plot and the background of it."
"Just musical instrumentals made this movie beautiful.","23 August 2021","10/10","This is one of the famous Disney movies but to be honest, it didn't impress me. I think I've watched this movie just once and it's enough.I think this movie set voice actors to the famous actors so it just got so much attention.Your closest person who looks like your best friend may be a real enemy. And I agree with that."
"One word aww","5 April 2007","10/10","This is another one of my favourite films it never grows old. It is perfect to all ages. The sound track is absolutely amazing i find myself singing along to all of the songs every time i watch it (nice one Elton). It is one of only two animated films which actually make me cry which i believe is pretty hard for a film to do. Erm it is my childhood film the one that you watch so much the tape began to go weird, it was one of the only films i bought in DVD to replace the tape. It suite's all ages and all sexes. It doesn't matter what kind of films you like you'll love The Lion King. It is ideal for sitting in with a pizza to watch with the family and friends."
"A good movie for all ages","17 January 2012","10/10","This movie still brings me to tears, even after all of these years! This is one of my favorite Disney movies, ranked high up on the list along with Tangled and Little Mermaid. I am so happy that they finally re-released it on DVD!! I only wish that I had bought it when it was first released on DVD so that I could have gotten the 2 disc special. Although some of the songs are cheesy and others are great, like, I Can't Wait to be King!! I believe that this movie will continue to be a Disney classic. I just hope that my kids will enjoy this movie as much as I always have.Hakuna Matata!"
"outstanding movie","7 November 2019","10/10","This movie is so great and fantastic for everyone, specially for kids. Nice animation and story of this movie. I can see it more than 2 times. really love this movie.
I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen. It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget. And hopefully, you won't either. A++"
"Beautiful","12 July 2019","10/10","After watching the copycat CGI version of this masterpiece, I went home and straight watched this again, cannot recommend enough to avoid the ""live-action"", and rewatch this instead. Amazing, incomparable."
"One of Disney's greatest movies","12 September 2013","10/10","A young lion cub named Simba is born, knowing that he will be the future king of the jungle. But after he is tricked into thinking that he killed his own father, the young cub runs away and goes into exile. When he grows older, he is forced to come back.It's pretty much common knowledge that Lion King is one of the best movies Disney has ever made. It embodies everything that makes Disney so great – excellent story, great characters, strong soundtrack, and a very capable cast of actors lending their voices.For me, the story is the best thing. Hamlet is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, and the writers have done a great job of transferring that to the animal kingdom. The scene between Simba and the ghost of Mufasa, in particular, is very emotional and tugs at the heart-strings. I'm surprised that the film was as short as it was, to be honest, I think it could have been fleshed out a little more. But what we do get is great.Simba also probably ranks up there as one of Disney's greatest creations. It is a brilliantly-crafted character, very well-voiced by Matthew Broderick. As a kid, I remember how beloved Timon and Pumbaa were, but I didn't really see the appeal. Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Scar (Jeremy Irons) are also very good. Coincidentally, 'The Lion King' marks the first time a major Disney character dies, which once again re-establishes the strength of the story.My only gripe with this movie is probably just the length. A little more time and the film could have been even better. But between the emotion, the brilliant songs ('Circle Of Life' is my personal favourite) and the fun characters, you have a classic. Not just a Disney classic, but a cinema classic.I'll stop masturbating now."
"A masterpiece","21 February 2022","7/10","Simply the greatest Disney film, and one of the best movies ever made.The story is simple but poignant, and it is beautifully told.I wish Disney was able to make films like this in the modern day of age, instead of focusing only in brand-type films."
"One of the best animated movie","8 June 2018","10/10","A masterpiece by Disney and still remembered by kids today as the best animation movie ever. Everyone has seen or at least heard about The Lion King and Simba's journey."
"The Lion King","26 August 2023","7/10","Certainly not one of Disney's better animations from a technical perspective - the artwork lacks the vibrancy and detail of many of their earlier stories; but the combined efforts of Sir Tim Rice, Elton John and Hans Zimmer make this an enjoyable fantasy adventure. It is told in two parts - the first sees a son ""Simba"" born to the king ""Mufasa""; a curious little fella who, alongside his friend ""Nala"" is inquisitive and mischievous - a real pain in the neck to the king's major-domo ""Zazu"". One fan the new cub really doesn't have, however, is the king's rather unimpressed brother ""Scar"" who hatches a plan to depose his brother and take over the kingdom. He manages to achieve exactly this and to get the youngster to blame himself and head off, alone, into exile. The second part is much more fun; he falls in with a warthog and is soon eating colourful grubs and living a peaceful, jolly life far from home. That idyllic existence is not to last long, however - ""Nala"" discovers he is still alive and races to alert him of the disaster that has befallen the kingdom under the rule of his uncle and his trusty band of hyenas. The musical numbers help it build to a gripping denouement, with clever, quite witty dialogue from some good - though not great - voice talents from the likes of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg to keep the pot boiling. It is an enjoyable film to watch but I wasn't captivated by it."
"a shining star in the history of animation","17 August 2011","4/10","Personally I enjoy most of Disney movies but this one has a special place for many reasons. The main one is that it brings me back to my childhood, and at that time I enjoyed the movie so much. I even had the VHS in English and Spanish version. Then the film came out on DVD and I also bought it. When it first came out on IMAX for any reason I couldn't go to see it again so now for the 3D release I definitely was not going to miss that opportunity. And all I can say is that this film will be forever inmortal. At the theater that I went there were people in the mid 20s like myself singing the songs, repeating the lines, it is just something that you don't see everyday. About the movie, everything has been said before: it is just so perfect, so balanced, it is a treat for the eyes for its amazing animation, it makes you laugh histerically with lovable characters like timon and pumba, it has a lot of emotional moments (spoilers) yes mufasas death is very sad but what really gets to me is when mufasa gets into the stampede to protect simba that is just heart breaking for me its not the death itself but the events that occur before his dead. Also at the very end when Simba takes his place as king is just magical, powerful it gives me chills when the bones are washed away by the rain while simba listens the voice of his father ""remember"" definitely this is pure gold a movie for old and young and a gem that will absolutely will pass the test of time."
"No bad, but it could be a lot better.","19 March 2014","10/10","The Lion King isn't a bad film. It just doesn't have anything unique and the songs are annoying as hell. The story also has a ton of stuff that isn't explained. Why doesn't Scar kill young Simba after killing Mufassa. Why does Nala travel all the way to where Simba was living with Timon and Puamba. Why is there a drought, famine, and bad weather when Scar rules. There are like all these animals, so why don't they overthrow Scar. When Simba returns to face his actions, no one supports him until he finds out he didn't kill his father. Why does the land turn back to normal after Simba returns. This is probably the most overrated Disney film, but not the worst."
"Not feeling the love tonight","20 February 2018","10/10","Difficult to deny the worldwide success of this Disney animated musical from which already has sprung a sequel, a theatrical show and now, we hear a live-action remake in the near future. And yet watching it for the first time, I'd be lion sorry, lying if I said I thought it was top drawer Disney. I've liked Elton John's music too for many years too but again didn't feel the songs he contributed (with Tim Rice as his lyricist) were his best work even if it did give his career an unexpected boost at the time.So what's not to like...well I struggled a little to side with the ruling Mafusa who when asked why it was okay for lions to eat antelopes, lamely proffered the line that lions turn back into grass when they die which then feeds the antelopes as part of the circle of life...that's not my understanding about evolution in the animal kingdom, where I thought survival of the fittest was the raison d'etre. I know the film is almost 25 years old but I also thought the animation quality wasn't of the highest while the characters repeat stock situations and emotions which Disney still peddles today, i.e. rebellious youngster leaves home before returning to heroically save the day against big bad baddie, in this case Simba's uncle Scar. Oh and of course there are cute side-attractions a-plenty, like the meerkat that thinks it's Groucho Marx, his less-than-sharp wild boar sidekick that definitely isn't a pig and a witch doctor funky gibbon all helping Simba in some way or other. I didn't really think the hyenas who support Scar were especially malevolent either.Maybe I'm just an old stick-in-the-mud but I just didn't think ""The Lion King"" lived up to expectations. No worries though or as they say in the film Hakuna Matata."
"Better than the remake","22 July 2019","10/10","Better than the 2019 remake. Animation for live action isn't a good switch on this movie. Animals in the original can express and show emotions, which kept me emotionally involved in the movie. The 2019 movie is absolutely stunning graphically, but couldn't get into it like the original because the animals can't express feeling in their voice or face."
"Of all the Disney movies growing up, this one has always been my favorite","13 April 2010","10/10","Yes, definitely my favorite hand drawn animated movie of all time. It was my favorite as a child and it still is now. This is an epic and cult tale based loosely on Shakespeare's Hamlet. Set in between Kenya or Tanzania, Africa at an unknown time, the king and queen of pride rock christen their son, Simba, as the new prince. His uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons), however, longs for the throne, so he conjures up several plans with the hyenas to get rid of the king Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Simba. The first one doesn't work, but in the second he is half successful. Luring Simba in a stampede of wilder-beasts (The goose bump-giving score by Hans Zimmer as powerful as ever at this point) Scar gets Mufasa to save him but then, as the king climbs to the top of a rock, Scar claws him and releases him. Simba then finds his father's dead body on the ground, and while mourning him, his uncle arrives, and convinces him it was his own fault, sending him away, with the hyenas on his tail to finish him off. Simba escapes everything and runs far away. He almost dies in the desert but is then rescued by meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane) and Warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) who teach him to adapt to a sort of hippie life of good times and bug eating. Now grown, Simba (Matthew Broderick) has a run in with Nala (Moira Kelly) his childhood friend, while she hunts Pumbaa. They fall in love and she tries to convince him to go back, but he refuses. Later, while in the grasslands, he meets up with the baboon that christened him, Rafiki, and he leads him out to speak with the ghost of his father, who reminds him of who he really is and what he must do. He speeds off back to his kingdom, now degrading under the false king, to reclaim his throne and set peace to Pride Rock.I couldn't give my opinion about this film without explaining the plot, if you'll forgive me. It really is a Disney classic that's unique in so many ways. The scene in which Simba tries to wake his dead father is horribly tragic, but extremely powerful. Disney already did something similar with Bambi, with the implication that the protagonist's mother had been killed. But it had never reached to the extent that the audience saw the death or the dead body of one of the parents. The Lion King is a 100 times more powerful than Bambi. Even though I never cried at that scene, I was always very uncomfortable with it. The script is also really cool and witty and should have been nominated for the 1994 Academy Awards, along with the winner Pulp Fiction."
"The Best Animated Film I'v Ever Seen","21 August 2008","9/10","This movie wasn't just another kid's animation movie, It was much more exciting than the other movie's, The Story Was Excellent, Every Character was noticeable and from my sight they was not boring at all, Not even one of them. They Created Simba very childish And naughty, But they also Add to him Innocent and honest. I think most of us like Timon And Pumba, I especially like Timon (Not only because I love meerkats) He's perpendicular and A show off, But there is something about him that easy to like, He's funny Sometime's He's even sensitive, Now Pumba, Thats one lovely warthog! He's so innocent, They add a lot to The Lion King. I'v seen this movie many time's, And every section that Mufasa died, I cried. The music was brilliant, very noticeable, They(Elton John, Tim Rice) Surely deserve an Oscar.The Best Animation Film. Sincerely, BanditIdan from the Bandit's Guild"

"It does what it says.","21 October 2013","7/10","I think the reviewers Stuckmann & Jahns will have the 2019 TLK Summer Blockbuster live action version on the worst of list in December.Still here in autumn 2013 the reviews are still coming in.Back then in Christmas 1994 I saw the movie in the cinema, and came back many times for this movie.The movie deserved some Oscars for use of sound.An all star cast are included with names like Whoopi Goldberg that suits her role as the crazy hyena Shenzi.Jeremy Irons does what he can to play the powerful villain that get what he deserved by being assaulted by the hyenas he had control over.Back at the beginning of the movie we see Simba the lion being raised with his family.But Simba's uncle Scar wants to kill Simba's father that is the king.Simba must flee after his father is killed under a wildebeest stampede.Now it's up to Simba as older later on to get revenge on Scar.This is a classic Disney movie with something for everyone.Songs both dark and playful, thrills and funny scenes.10/10"
"Forget every Disney movie you ever witnessed","25 April 2008","NA","From the rising sun, to the up roaring film finale the lion king is the Disney film i hold closest to my childhood. I can still remember being 3 years old and getting to the cinema late, and cheering out loud at the end, yeah it would seem that now at the age of 16 turning 17 i'd have seen films a lot more closer to home and i have, but as a young child i was very observant of characters even though they were cartoons. Even though I was only three i never forget the film, I never cried at the sad points of the film and no i never really fully understood it until i watch it a few years later but i always remembered Simba's realisation that his life would never be the same. If you haven't seen the lion king *slap in the face* believe me you are missing what i describe as the last Disney film old Walt would be proud of. 10/10"
"Kimba The Hamlet","4 July 2019","NA","I remember watching this as a kid and fairly enjoying it but was surprised to know how much praise it got when I grew up. Even on this rewatch it is pretty good and entertaining. But besides the circle of life concept everything else is quite regressive themes. Add the fact that they never gave credit to Kimba, I think my rating is much higher than it should be."
"Amazing!","13 June 2008","10/10","There is no word to describe how great this movie really is, not just as an animated movie but as a proper movie too. I watched it today because i have missed it, it's been 7 or 8 years since i watched this movie, the music i mean is amazing and special thanks to Elton John for that. This is the building block for all animated movies, well done to Disney, directors, animators and actors for such an amazing movie. I guess no matter how old you are you are bound to love this movie, i have found nothing wrong with it at all, it is legendary if you have not watched it yet you definitely should.Storyline great, animation great, music amazing almost everything about this movie is spot on.It will always have a special place in everyone's heart. I guess one word to describe it is Epic!"
"Exhilarating highs--preachy, syrupy lows...","5 February 2007","6/10","Great-looking but preachy, ""uplifting"" Disney animated opus from an original story concerns a young jungle lion who has gone into a sort of self-imposed exile after blaming himself for his father's demise, soon befriended by two clowning creatures who help teach the cub about Life. Fine voice-work from Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, James Earl Jones and Nathan Lane, many exciting and amusing moments, but nearly left sodden by a cloying, sugary song-score by Elton John and Tim Rice, with every tune underlining the ""message"" inherent in each sequence. Much of the talk is just Psychobabble 101, making the last fifteen or so minutes a chore to get through. The craftsmanship of the film's designers is really something to see, despite the fact the picture only won Oscars for its music (the score and the song, ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"", which sounds like a commercial jingle). **1/2 from ****"
"""Hamlet"" it ain't - good Disney, it ain't either, I'm afraid to say","13 September 2009","3/10","For starters, I've been a big Disney and animation fan all my life; seeing Pinocchio at a pretty early age and ""Robin Hood"" on its initial release made huge impacts on me, and by the time this film came out I'd caught up with all of the Disney features. I loved - and still love - the early work, and have mixed reactions to most of the stuff from ""Peter Pan"" through ""Oliver and Company"" with a few exceptions. ""The Little Mermaid"" seemed like a return to form - and a return to the fairy tales that the company always seemed to do best with, and I liked ""Beauty and the Beast"" even more. ""Aladdin"" was alas a major step down - still pretty solid in the animation department, but Robin Williams' shtick was for me completely out of place and irritating. It was of course their biggest hit to that point, and they took some of the lessons they'd learned - less romance, more slapstick and gross humor, celebrity voices - and applied them to ""The Lion King"" with even more spectacular results.For 15 years this film has ranked among my worst films of all time, and every time I mention that I get people reacting as if I told them I was the Antichrist. Seriously - I think more people will get bent out of shape if you tell them you hate ""The Lion King"" than if your feelings are negative about ""Citizen Kane"", ""Casablanca"", or ""2001"". It's always struck me as weird, because I know I'm not the only person to dislike it, and in fact none of the friends I saw it with when it came out liked it much - though none of them hated it like I did either.I think that the main problem for me in 1994 is that the elements that I disliked from ""Aladdin"" in particular seemed amped-up several degrees here. I hated Whoopi and Cheech, hated the music, hated above all what I saw at the time was an infantilist assault on intelligence and wit - the smartest and coolest character in the film, Scar, also is pure evil, and all of the ""good"" characters are white-bread, boring, stupid. Dumb and strong triumphs over smart and clever; the songs sucked; the animation was coarser and less interesting than in the previous couple of films. I suspect that there were a lot of personal issues that contributed to my overwhelming hatred of the film, too, but those are lost to me at the moment.I'm pleased to say on this re-watch that I don't HATE the film anymore. But I still don't like it. The issues with the treatment of Scar - not sure what I was thinking there, that was over-the-top on my part. Sure Jeremy Irons' voicing of him is in many ways a typical smart but venal character, a Godless intellectual I suppose - but it's not really that overstated or deliberate, it doesn't come off as anti-intellectual to me anymore. James Earl Jones' Mufasa may not be a genius, but he doesn't come off as a dumb noble-hearted brute either, and nobody can really beat Jones in that kind of role. The opening sequences are somewhat impressive, and the film is rarely boring. I actually sort of liked the shaman baboon character Rafiki (Robert Guillaume), and it's good that young Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas/Matthew Broderick) takes a fair amount of screen time to grow up.But...I still hate the music; ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" I actually found tolerable in relation to the other songs, but even it was so cloying and just banal that I had a hard time not fast-forwarding. This is purely a matter of taste, I make no bones about it - I like very little of Elton John's post-1970s work and so it's not surprising really. I still find the hyena characters irritating, unfunny, and way over-used. The female characters are essentially just there to move the action forward - no, the film ain't obviously racist like I guess I thought it was (though it's rather confusing in its racial and ethnic undertones) but it's definitely a boys' film. Timon and Pumbaa are gross and annoying and the film as a whole just has no sparkle, no wit to me. The animation doesn't have the zip or the beauty of the previous few films; the direction and pacing seem more inevitable than exciting, the ""spectacular"" scenes like the stampede that kills Mufasa just don't come off as all that spectacular as the digital help is too obvious and cheap-looking.In any case, it wasn't torture to watch anymore, and it's actually reawakened an interest in going back through the Disney feature canon, re-watching some of the ones I don't remember well and catching up with a few of the newer ones that I never bothered with after being disappointed by this and ""Pocahontas"" in succession."
"An impressive animated movie.","26 June 2004","9/10","""The Lion King"" is and will always will be regarded as one of the better Disney movies. And it deserves that!First of all the movie looks visually splendid! The African land scape's are beautiful and so are the animations of the animals itself.What makes ""The Lion King"" such a special movie is the emotional dept the story has. The story plays a significant role in the movie and it has some good adult moments. The entire movie has a more of an adult feeling, unlike earlier made Disney's that mainly focused on only young children. Still there also is plenty to enjoy for the young ones, especially the characters Timon and Pumbaa shall be loved by them.The story is filled with symbolism and reference to mainly the communist regime.The voice cast is good, mainly of course thanks to James Earl Jones who has an amazing good deep voice. Also the three hyenas are voiced perfectly by Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings. Jeremy Irons who voices the main villain Scar really brings his character to live and makes the movie even more worth watching.There are some typical Disney songs that are good. Also surprising good is the musical score itself composed by Hans Zimmer who also received an Oscar for it. His first and only one but hopefully not his last. Also Tim Rice and Elton John received an Oscar for the song "" Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" and were nominated for two other songs from this movie.A must see animated movie with some scene's and songs that you'll not easily forget.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"One of my favourite movies","31 July 2019","10/10","After watching the live action movie and watching this I remembered how much better this movie was and just wanted to say it."
"The One True King of animated films!","28 September 2011","10/10","This is my all-time favorite movie! This movie has been a part of my life since I was an infant. I am now 18, which has given me plenty of time to ponder why this film has been and continues to be a huge success. I think it's so popular for one reason: It appeals to both young and old film viewers, and here's why.First, for kids, it has great music, it's funny, and has great characters, voiced by an extraordinary cast, which are qualities that make a great animated film. It's easy for an animated film to entertain children, but it's really something when adults are touched by it as well. I think one of the reasons adults like this movie so much is that it does not act like a children's film. It acts like a drama made for adults. The plot is fairly simple, but its themes, emotion, and the psychology of the characters within are things that only mature audiences will truly understand. The plot is basically about a young cub, named Simba. He loves his father, Mufasa, is eager to become king one day, and is fascinated by all he sees and hears. His life takes a very bad turn when his uncle, Scar, kills his father in order to gain the throne. He sends the cub into exile. Simba meets some new friends, Timon and Pumbaa, who raise him with a no worries lifestyle until his best friend from home, Nala, and a wise baboon, Rafiki, encourage him to return home and claim his rightful place as king. As I said, this plot is very basic. However, what is not so basic is the feelings of guilt that Simba feels for the death of his father and the psychological trauma that he has to endure for the rest of the film. Again, what is not so simple is the themes. Simba's father appears to him in the clouds and tells him ""Remember who you are."" This message basically states that a person cannot shirk their responsibilities, a message that a toddler cannot begin to understand. In addition to that, the film sums up what life is all about: Going through hard times, dealing with it, and coming out stronger because you endured it. I think the adults that watch this film grasp that concept and appreciate it. My own grandmother, who's in her eighties, bought her own copy of this film!In addition to these things, the film has other elements that cannot be ignored. The first is definitely the wonderful music and songs. Hans Zimmer made the score for this film and won a much deserved Oscar for it. Elton John and Tim Rice also won Oscars for their brilliant work on this film. The songs that they created, like Circle of Life, Hakuna Matata, and Can You Feel the Love Tonight, are so well written that you can't help but be touched by them. The African words sung by Lebo M. contribute highly to the majesty of the film. When Lebo's team first sings, you automatically know that you're in Africa. From his birth to his ascension as king, Simba's journey is wondrously captured through the music and songs that the film provides. Another thing that makes this film so wonderful is the animation. Every single tree, animal, and background that appears on the screen is a stunning work of art. People that do not like this movie will usually admit that the animation is absolutely stunning. It has to be wonderful when the animators actually went to Africa and brought lions into their studio! While all of the other things about this film are wonderful, my personal favorite is the villain, Scar. He is so wonderfully voiced, animated, and brought to life that you love him, hate him, and may even be scared by him all at once. Jeremy Irons, Andreas Deja, and everyone else who worked on this character created one of the best villains in film history. He is the only animated villain to be nominated for an MTV best villain award, and is widely considered to be one of the best Disney villains of all time. Scar is so magnificent that he is in the same category with Hannibal Lecter and Ledger's Joker. The Lion King has many wonderful things that make it spectacular, but, for me, it would not be the same without Scar. A very close second to Scar is Mufasa. He is so incredibly voiced that I cannot imagine anyone else playing him. James Earl Jones brings the qualities of a commanding leader and a wonderful, loving father at the same time to this character that you can't help but feel sad when he is killed. These two characters alone make the film worth seeing. Add everything else that is great about it, and you have one of the best films ever made.The Lion King has been entertaining audiences for 17 years and will do so for many years more. With its great vocal talent, animation, songs, music, and themes, the Lion King has earned its spot in IMDb's top 250 films ever made. I do not thing it will be leaving the list any time soon. It's a real shame that it was not nominated for best picture. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wishes to see a children's film that goes beyond the typical feel good animated film. With the possible exception of Beauty and the Beast, this is definitely the King of all animated films! If you haven't seen it, in 2D or 3D, I strongly encourage you to do so. You won't regret it!"
"One of the best animated films of all time","23 February 2022","9/10","Lion cub Simba runs away from home due to guilt at having caused his father's death. He grows up carefree and merry with friends Timon and Pumbaa but when he comes of age, he finds himself unable to ignore his responsibility as the lion king, especially when his father's pride has been driven to such a miserable state by his uncle.The score by Hans Zimmer and songs by Elton John and Tim Rice greatly contribute to this movie's unforgettable charm."
"Best animated movie of all time!","22 July 2019","10/10","Best animated of all time! That's it, that's the review!"
"The only movie worth 10 of 10!","22 October 1998","10/10","The intro is better than in any Broccoli-Bond, the plot has a age-span that exceeds 25 years. I watched it together with my daughter, and we both enjoyed the movie but from two different horizons... And the characteristics are better placed than in any heavy Ingmar Bergman-movie.I was seven years old when The Jungle Book first appeared, my daughter was 6 when The Lion King came - suddenly I understood why it is The Greatest Movie I have ever seen."
"SuperCalafFagalisticExpialadoshus","2 December 2015","6/10","""The water hole?"" I can watch this movies over and over and over again. I can sing the songs on karaoke and quote lines from top to bottom. Hands down!!! The best movie since I was a kid....""I'm gonna be a mighty Queen, so enemies beware..."" I had this classic on VHS and then on DVD, now Blue-Ray. This is one of those movies that you sit down and watch with your babies and then you pass it along.The storyline was awesome: Very good life lessons about trust, family true friendship, and love that is genuine. This movie depicts the importance of wisdom and the law of sowing and reaping. The vocal tactics were superior and the vocal acting was phenomenal. James Earl Jones is a winner every time."
"One of the best Disney in later years","18 March 2005","9/10","As usual has Disney made an outstanding film - tecnically speaking. Great animation are Disneys trademark and it shows!! The acting and music are also ""First Class"", especially Jeremy Irons (he is a wonderful singer). The story is one of the best in Disneys history - Its dealing with the problems of taking responsibility for ones actions in life and the pain of losing someone that you love. I would like to see that more often in Disneys movies...Unfortunately it is a ripoff of Tesuka Osamus ""Janguru Taitei aka Kimba The White Lion"" (there has been a lot of discussions about this so I'm not going to dig deeper into it) and that is a bit of a disgrace that they never admitted that (instead of threatening to sue those who pointed that out).Despite that, it is still one of the best Disneys, so it has my blessing ;)"
"A Moralistic Approach in The Lion King","29 November 2011","7/10","The Lion King (1994) Movie Review Directed by: Rob Minkoff and Roger Allers The Lion King is more than just a Disney animation. Its two Oscar wins was well-deserved. The main characters – Simba, Mufasa, Scar, Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa exemplify the different traits present in our society. Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff work together to direct a film that not only shows us the beauty of life and nature, but the moral values we should all seek to sustain who we are. Roger Allers is credited for writing some of the best known Disney classic films such as Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992). Robert Minkoff not only directed The Lion King but other movies such as Stuart Little (1999) and The Forbidden Kingdom (2008). These two directors teamed together to play a role in a film that had a moralistic approach. Life is wonderful – don't run away from it, appreciate it and always know family and friends can help you in ways you'd never expect.Looking beyond the obvious characters on screen, each of them can be characterized by a specific expectation. Simba must transition from a young cub (boy) to a leader (adult). Mufasa must rule a land and protect his family; he went as far as he could to protect his son – to the point where he lost his life. Mufasa's fatherly actions teach us that with true love, a parent is willing to exceed limitations to secure his own child. Scar is a representation of evil, greed, and jealousy. He was willing to kill his own brother and nephew to assume a higher rank. He is often portrayed with many high angles, a sign of his dominance and leadership amongst the hyenas and the power he holds over them. Timon and Pumbaa represent the friends who support and guide you when you're troubled. The comedic sense of the duo lightens up the mood of young Simba, giving the viewer reassurance upon Simba's faith and emotions. Nala gives the film a romantic turn, adding on to the idea that love and support can guide someone in the right direction. A major influence that aided the communication in the film was the musical score. In the scene in which Mufasa explains to Simba what the stars in the sky were, a significant musical score plays in the background. This same musical score appears again when Simba is grown and tells Timon and Pumba his father's explanation of the stars. As Simba walks away from his two friends, it presents itself as Simba's remembers his father. This music appears more than once in the film, setting up a connection between previous and present scenes, it was placed at each particular point of the film for a reason. The color and lighting tones between Mufasa and Scar gave way to the differences between them. The darker tones represented Scar's faded thoughts. The little lighting provided in his scenes showed that he was of a sadistic nature whereas Mufasa is presented in brighter lighting among nature and mostly outdoors. Scar is usually located in the interior of a cave or other dwelling – enclosing him in the darkness that eventually drives his jealousy. Cultural aspects of Africa are introduced immediately in the beginning of the film with the first song. The majority of the animals also show the beauty of nature and the variety of animal life that exists. The song ""The Circle of Life"" sets off a major theme of the film – creating the idea that life is a constant circle, there is life and then there is death. After Mufasa dies, a new ruler had to assume his position – Simba. The circle kept going until the film concluded with a new life – the child of Simba and Nala. Once again, the circle has fulfilled its goal of life and death. ""The amazing thing is that I think when we (Rob Minkoff and Roger Allers) made this movie; it's safe to say that we didn't really fully understand the impact this movie was going to have on people.and how long it was going to kind of stick around."" The Lion King shares that universal theme that we are all part of ""the circle of life"", live life with true happiness and do the right thing. Take out time to love those who care and not to back down from fear – face it. Rob Winkoff and Roger Allers may not have realized it when the film was released in 1994, but The Lion King has become a Disney classic, true to the standards of morality and teaching us how magical and complex life is truly is."
"Great","13 May 2018","5/10","The lion king is a beautiful and hopeful film destined to be a classic 
Don't be fooled this movie is not only for kids 
Recommended"
"Overrated","18 February 2023","10/10","I must have missed something because I just don't get the love for this movie. First, I have too many questions. This pride (much larger than a normal pride) has a huge amount of lionesses, but only two male lions. So who is Nala's Father? Either Mufasa or Scar, which makes her Simba's sister or cousin, and their romance a little disturbing, but I guess that doesn't matter in the lion world. Then after Scar is gone, I guess Simba is the only male? I know, I'm overly analytical, but details like this bother me. I find it hard to believe Mufasa didn't realize how much Scar hated him, and didn't take more precautions around him. All that aside, James Earl Jones is the perfect voice for Mufasa and Jeremy Irons is perfect as Scar. Rowen Atkinson as Zazu, Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi, Cheech Marin as Banzai, Robert Guillaume as Rafiki, and the wonderful Nathan Lane as Timon all do a perfect job. Unfortunately I have a problem with Matthew Broderick as Simba. I love Matthew and he's a great actor, but to me his voice just wasn't the right choice for Simba. The music also leaves me cold; none of the songs are memorable and I really hate ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"". Sorry Sir Elton, but it's so syrupy and cheesy it makes me gag. This story has one of the most heart-wrenching death scenes of any Disney movie with Mufasa's death, and Scar's death, although not shown, has severe implied violence; all a little much for young kids. It's an okay movie but not one of my favorites."
"One of the best of the best","5 August 2017","10/10","I hadn't thought much of The Lion King back then because I'd watch anything. But now that I'm older, I can see why many people agree that it's one of the best movies, and I agree. There may be spoilers ahead, so you have been warned.The animation's great, I really like the songs (especially Circle Of Life and Be Prepared), and I also like the characters (like Mufasa, Rafiki, and Timon and Pumbaa). Out of Disney's protagonists, I feel that Simba's story is one that'll always be told for many years to come. From a cub who can't wait to be king to an exiled prince whose father had been killed by his uncle and finally to be a king, retaking the Pridelands from his cruel uncle Scar. This movie has some hidden good values as well, such as heroism, faith, hope, and reconciliation.That's why I think that The Lion King is not only one of the best Disney movies, but it's also one of the best animated movies ever. So on a scale from one to ten, I'd give it a perfect ten, and I'd definitely recommend this...and even though The Lion King (1994) will always be better than The Lion King (2019), I hope the remake will be good."
"A Disney classic","8 August 2019","10/10","In the African savannah King Mufasa, a lion, rules over the Pride Lands. He explains to his son, a young cub named Simba, that one day he will be the king... but before that he has a lot to learn. There are dangers, even for lions. The greatest danger comes from Simba's Uncle Scar; an embittered lion with a Machiavellian streak. Scar wants to rule but to do that he needs to rid himself of Mufasa and Simba... he has plans. One day Scar's plan works; Mufasa is dead and Simba leaves the Pride Lands believing he is to blame for his father's death. He grows up learning to take things easy with new friends Pumbaa and Timon, a warthog and meerkat. Scar now rules the pride with the help of the hyenas. When Simba learns of how bad things have got in the Pride Lands he will have to decide whether to continue the easy life or fight to make things better.This film is definitely one of Disney's classics; it has a fine story, some great characters and catchy songs. Simba is a decent protagonist even if the plot demands that he isn't too strong early on and Scar is a great villain; as are his trio of hyena acolytes. Given the film's 'U' certificate I was surprised at how dark it is in places; some scenes might disturb younger viewers as characters are often in real danger. The voice cast is very impressive; notably Jeremy Irons, as Scar, James Earl Jones, as Mufasa, and Rowan Atkinson, as Zazu the hornbill who is Mufasa's majordomo. As one would expect from Disney the animation and character designs are all really good. Overall I'd definitely recommend this for all but the youngest children and adults alike."
"Brilliant film-but possibly even more traumatic than Bambi","21 December 2006","10/10","And here's my spoiler, up front: not only is the young lion's father killed in front of him, he's made to feel it's his own fault. Surely this is even more traumatic than the death of Bambi's mother. And yet, I have to rank this as one of Disney's very best--the color, design, characterizations,and music are all superb. The use of earth tones, so different from Disney's usual bright palette, is stunning and perfect for the story. (And here I want to add that the soundtrack is also excellent--my only quibble being that the powerful ""Circle Of Life"" should have won for best song instead of the pretty but vapid ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"". But that being said, I believe that, like ""Beauty and the Beast,"" should have been nominated as picture of the year. If you haven't seen this, what are waiting for?--arnie113_________________________"
"An animated film can be just as good or if not better than a real life film.","26 July 2017","10/10","This is in my top 3 animation films of all time. I don't think that any animation film before it managed to enter the hearts of both children and adults at once like this one. An ensemble cast with such a gripping tale, great music and superb animation, made this one of the all time greats. The characters are so well flushed out and each scene is so memorable. I cannot stress just how good this film is. Without a doubt the peak of Disney and to this day they have not made anything this original and so influential. The creators gave us such a good villain and great hero's that in my opinion shows that an animated film can be just as good or if not better than a real life film."
"One of Disney's best","14 July 2019","10/10","The Lion King is one of Disney's all time best films with a great combination of humour and emotion. The animation is incredible and it's extremely well paced. The performances from all of it's excellent cast are great. Hans Zimmer's score is amazing. All of the songs are all fantastic and it's consistently very funny. Its also extremely emotional and comes to a very satisfying and thrilling conclusion."
"Brilliant, no other words needed.....","22 July 2017","6/10","The Lion King is not just my favourite animated movie, its one of my favourite movies in its own right. The animation was amazing, and captured the essences of the Savannah brilliantly. The story and plot was one which people of all ages, not just children, could follow and understand, an impressive achievement for an animated movie, one scene in particular wouldn't leave a dry eye in the house, no matter what age the viewer may be, such was its emotional power. The voice acting was some of the best I've seen, particularly James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson and Jeremy Irons, and of course Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, who at times were flat out hilarious as Timon and Pumba. The music and songs didn't disrupt the scenes they were in, if anything they added to it, particularly the opening song The Circle Of Life which was the best opening to an animated movie I've seen so far. Some have criticized the portrayal of certain animals like the hyena's and the movie doesn't depict life on the plains accurately, well the correct response to that is, its only a story and it isn't meant to as its not a nature documentary. This is a timeless classic which will never age, the fact that it took twenty years for another animated movie to overtake it as the highest-grossing animated movie is a testament to just how brilliant this movie is. A classic which all the family will enjoy."
"Music Lovers Must See","20 March 2015","9/10","The Lion King movie is a great Disney must see for children and adults. The music is wonderful and the story is great ! I think any music lover will appreciate this film. The colors in the film are beautiful. I have watched the Lion King numerous times and now own the DVD. I would advise any Disney fan to see this movie. Also the DVD purchase would be a great gift for any Disney fan. The story in the Lion King is easy to follow and suspenseful for children and adults. The part in the movie when the father dies is quite sad and may make smaller children upset. The words in the music are catchy and fun to sing along with. My favorite song in the movie is Hakuna Mata."
"Classic Though Not a Fave","18 September 2020","6/10","I watched this again and it was boring. I don't know. It just didn't have the spark like other Disney movies do.I mean we all know the story and have seen it. Nothing really to say here. I don't think it's that good.Worth watching though6 stars"
"An epic masterpiece","31 January 2012","3/10","This is one of the best movies of all time. Not just in terms of animated movies, but ALL movies ever made.One of the last films in Disney's 10-year era of blockbusters and critically acclaimed films.Magnificently animated with incredibly well-composed music. It is more an art than a movie.This film has everything, Mystery, Romance, sad moments and moments of great joy. It's a film for all ages, even those who do not like animated / cartoon can see the class of this movie.The sad thing about this film is that no one longer creates masterpieces like this.10 out of 10."
"Whole family will thoroughly enjoy this one","26 January 2008","NA","I have a confession to make. This is the first fully animated Disney production that I have ever seen! Perhaps some would say that I have begun at the wrong end (beside the fact that I have been living in a closet all my life), however ""The Lion King"" (Disney's 32nd full length animated feature) has given me an inkling of what I may have been missing.Disney continue their recent trend of popular animated features by bringing us this tale about the circle of life. Young lion cub ""Simba"", heir to his father ""King Mufasa's"" throne, thinks there'll be nothing to assuming his rightful place at the top of the food chain. Things look terribly gloomy though when Simba's evil Uncle Scar kills Mufasa, takes his brother's place as king and drives poor Simba far from his home. The dramatic adventure story that unfolds from here is good, and will keep the kids involved, yet the movie's real strength is its sharp wit and very funny dialogue. Several moments will have you in stitches, while movie buffs will delight in ""performances"" from many recognisable voices. James Earl Jones is an appropriate choice for Mufasa, Jeremy Irons' Scar is wonderfully sardonic, while comedienne Whoopi Goldberg is a real treat as a nasty Hyena. Listen too for the voices of Matthew Broderick, Rowan Atkinson, Cheech Marin, Robert Guillaume, Ernie Sabella, Nathan Lane and Moira Kelly.""The Lion King"" is a joy musically too, with Hans Zimmer providing a vibrant African score and both Elton John and Tim Rice some catchy show numbers, including Elton's beautiful love theme ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" Disney's high production values are clearly evident in a fine animated film which the whole family is sure to thoroughly enjoy.Saturday, October 29, 1994 - Knox District Centre"
"How on earth did this get such high ratings? What has society come to?","15 December 2014","NA","I'm sure I'll get many down votes on this review, seeing that so many people seem to think it's this amazing animated experience. Well, this is just my opinion, you can like it or leave it, to each their own and I only hope I never have to watch this thing ever again.I only ever saw The Lion King twice, both times were involuntary. The first time, I was six years old, sitting in a movie theater with my parents and eating this nasty bright yellow popcorn. So, the movie began, and I nearly fell asleep sitting through the annoying intro music and strange ""lion birth ritual"" thing with this wizzled up monkey holding up a lion to the sun (by that point I was hoping the monkey would drop the lion off the cliff but sadly not all wishes come true). For the next little while there was some dopey singing that I'm surprised didn't give the whole audience brain damage, and this scene with these freaky drunk-looking hyenas (I was six, it freaked me the hell out back then). Next thing I know the father lion gets killed, which shocked all the kids in the audience, many parents carried their screaming and crying children out of the theater by that point, mine included. Thank you mom and dad, you saved my childhood.Recently my friend dragged me along to see it again at her house (she's a huge Disney fan, I'm more of an X-Files and Cold Case person). She kept on saying, ""isn't this a masterpiece? It's so breathtaking!"" and all I could do was try to block my mind of the two annoying singing animals (a pig and a squirrel-thing) who were on-screen singing this bizarre new-agey song thing and they adopted the baby lion, god knows why. Well, I told her exactly what I thought of The Lion King, and it involved many swear words. Her comeback to me was: ""You only hate it because it's Disney, you just don't understand its amazing moments!"" Alright, true, I'm not a big fan of Disney, I think it's a load of commercialized, always happy garbage that stupefies children. That being said, there are a few Disney films I didn't mind: Alice In Wonderland (the 1950's cartoon version), Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, The Beauty and The Beast, Monster's Inc., Toy Story, The Aristocats and Oliver & Company are the few Disney films I've seen and thought were okay.""You hate it because of the singing!"" was her next argument.Well yeah, the songs in this movie were terrible, that goes without saying. But it would be dumb to hate a movie based primarily on its soundtrack.""You hate it because it's popular!"" she said then.Harry Potter, Goosebumps, The X-Files, Criminal Minds, Cold Case, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Romero's Living Dead films, those films/TV shows are extremely popular and I love them! The Lion King is just stupid, plain and simple.""Okay, then you hate the actors,"" she concluded, looking unsure of herself at this point. (I just wanted to go home).I have nothing against the voice actors, they weren't bad (my all-time favorite actor, William B. Davis, has never been in any Disney movies, thank god).In my opinion, The Lion King was just a stupid movie and a waste of time, nobody has to agree with me. But I'd say it deserves 3/10 stars, definitely not the 8.5/10 stars it currently has."
"nostalgia","2 April 2017","10/10","A movie I watched at very young ages. It's a beautiful masterpiece that I make different meanings in each age. The universality of his subject makes the film constantly up-to-date and traceable. It is a beautiful masterpiece that brings new meaning to every view. The lion king in short"
"Regele Leu","18 February 2016","10/10","This is really the best Disney movie.... it contains everything, drama, romance, action...everything to make you happy and to motivate you watching this.

"A masterpiece","20 October 2019","10/10","Arguably Disney's best film of all time, the Lion King is beautifully set in the African Serengeti. The soundtrack is perfect, the dialogue is excellent, and the voice performances by the actors are top notch. As an adult, I appreciate the humor that I missed as a kid and that is what sets this film apart; it can be watched by audiences of all ages. James Earl Jones was most fitting as Mufasa, as were the rest of the actors in their roles. A true epic."
"A great movie","1 April 2021","10/10","An awesome movie , perfect for every age ! Recommend it !"
"Lion cub finds identity and returns to be King,","24 September 2015","10/10","I love this movie and it is by far one of my favorites. The movie ""The Lion King"" is an animated movie that came out in 1994. It was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff. The screenplay writers are Irene Mecchi and Jonathan Roberts. The movie is about a lion cub that looks up to his father Mufasa ""The King"" for everything. He wants to be just like his dad, and be just as brave as his dad. One day, Mufasa gets a message about a herd of animals being on the move and it is to concern the King. The King sees his son clenched to a branch hanging on for his dear life. Mufasa goes to save his son, and in the process, his brother Scar chose to murder him instead of saving his life. Simba did not see Scar kill his father so Scar simply blamed Simba for his death. He forced Simba to run away and never come back. Simba gets out of the pride lands and goes to search for his own identity and find who he really is. He hates himself because he believes he has killed his father. Simba then meets Timon and Pumbaa. Timon and Pumbaa are a meerkat and a warthog. They welcomed Simba and told Simba about themselves by singing a song ""Hakuna Matata."" One day, Simba was out and ran into a beautiful lady lion. They played and later found out that was Nora, his childhood friend. Nora lectured Simba, and told him how scar was ruling Pride Rock. Simba then returns to confront Scar about what truly happened. He fought for his land back and was finally announced King of pride rock."
"Master piece","24 April 2017","10/10","Definitely a classic! This movie will go on and on through generations without getting old and without even one person who won't fell in love with it. Love the animation, the plot, the songs and everything. Essential movie for anyone ever on Earth. Will remain one of the great master pieces of animation. Just enjoy it and Hakuna Matata!"
"The Lion King 3D: a reissue that feels like a new release","5 October 2011","7/10","For Disney The Lion King really is the cat that got the cream. Since the original film opened 17 years ago the film has taken $4.6 billion worldwide and has spawned one of the most successful shows in Broadway history.With such success one could be forgiven for thinking that the film's new release in 3D was just Disney finding a way of milking a successful franchise. Yet with The Lion King it doesn't feel this way.The story deserves to be told again for a new audience. Those who grew up with this film will perhaps now have children of their own, or merely want to escape back to their childhood. Either way The Lion King has aged well, the story is as compelling, as emotional and as funny as ever.This stems from its characters, the story's moral heart and the performances which bring it all to life. Watch any other Disney film and you will struggle to find a character as evil as Scar, nor a scene as moving as Simba's last with his father Mufasa. The cast including Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, Matthew Broderick and Rowan Atkinson deliver each line with relish.Yet at the risk of stating the obvious, it is Hans Zimmer's soundtrack and Elton John/Tim Rice's songs which really makes the film sing. People across the world may know the words to ""Hakuna Matata"", ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"" and ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight?"", but what's forgotten is how important they are to the story and how well the whole film fits together with its musical moments.However despite its status as a timeless classic 3D doesn't work particularly well with the 2D animations of old Disney films. For a start the characters still sing about a circle of life rather than a sphere. To be serious, if you watch this film expecting to have to cower to avoid a herd of wildebeest then you'll be disappointed.But the 3D does have its own charms, different to other 3D films. There is theatricality about this version of The Lion King that allows you to take in the beauty of the African backdrop whilst still focussing on the story front of stage. It makes each scene's colours more vibrant, stopping a brilliant story beginning to look visually tired and old.Despite the fact that The Lion King came out 17 years ago, watching this reissue feels like a new release. That is partly due to the facelift Disney has given it but really it is because it was such a good film in the first place. For that alone watching Simba's journey again is well worthwhile.Verdict:  With a story this good Disney could do little wrong and they haven't.For more reviews read http://www.theupcoming.co.uk"
"The end of an era...","17 January 2010","8/10","The 32nd animated Disney classic is one of Disney's best known films. It is considered by many 'the best' of Disney. I don't agree with that, there are better films. But still, it is the last of a kind.I first saw it in the cinema in December 1994, with my parents, sister, godfather and his wife and kids. I was 10 at the time. It was in a cinema I used to go many times back then and which I first saw other Disney films, like 'Aladdin' and 'Beauty and the Beast', for example.The original 1994 version is the true version for me. The version with that dumb 'Morning Report' scene has no reason to exist and is completely unnecessary. Seriously, did they think that people were really gonna accept that? Aside that it's the same movie but why changing a movie, even if it's only for 1 minute?The beauty of the artwork is one of the film's best attributes. It shows us beautiful landscapes of Africa and includes, among other things, the gorgeous sunrises and sunsets characteristic of Africa. We know this takes place somewhere in Africa but we don't know where exactly. They call it ""Pride Lands"" in the film...The lions and lionesses are extremely well drawn and handsome and their roars are very realistic, so much that I wonder if they used real lions in stage or if it was very talented people roaring like that.Simba is very pretty and cute as a lion cub and grows looking similar to his father. Mufasa always fascinated me and even now he still fascinates me: he is a gorgeous lion, powerful, with an imposing and majestic figure, a strong voice, a brutal strength and an amazing physique. Mufasa really is a 'Sir Lion'.Scar is one of the great Disney villains and he really has that cold and harsh look on his face and eyes.Timon and Pumba are two goofy but funny characters. They are clearly stupid, but more of a comic relief than anything else. I don't particularly like the hyenas, but Ed is a funny one, perhaps for being a mute character like Dopey ('Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs') and Gideon ('Pinocchio'). It's hilarious when Ed laughs hysterically because of the way Mufasa scared them away.However, Mufasa's death is one of the most severe things for a child to watch and the sequence itself is depressing, easy to make some tears come to our eyes.As for the voice cast, talents vary, but some do an excellent job, like James Earl Jones as Mufasa, Jonathan Taylor Thomas as infant Simba, Jeremy Irons as Scar and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu.The soundtrack is great. It has two versions of 'Circle of Life' and 'Can you feel the love tonight'. In the case of 'Circle of Life', I like both versions. In the case of 'Can you feel the love tonight', I prefer Elton John's version.I also enjoy the songs 'Hakuna Matata', 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight', 'Be Prepared' and the silly song 'Asante sana squash banana', but I adore 'I Just Can't Wait To Be King' and those instrumental-vocal songs which resemble African sounds and at the same time they have this dark feeling in them. The movie's environment is a mix of paradise and darkness."
"Still love it after 12 years","13 January 2007","7/10","After 12 years I re-watched its DVD version and I still love it. It's simple, straightforward but excellent for everyone.Simba, a young lion, is going to be the future king. But his vicious uncle, Scar, who is so jealous of him and his father, Mufasa, cooperates with the Hyenas, kills Mufasa and makes Simba leave guiltily. After years Simba has grown up and met his best friend, Nala, again and decides not to escape from his guilt any more.Music is always Disney's strength and it's particular good in this film. The songs has already become classics and it's really cheering when you listen to them. With them you just don't feel like watching the film for one and a half hours.The message is very positive. Disney makes use of the impression the public has of lions to show that even someone really strong can be weak sometime. No matter what has come what you should do is face it and deal with it but not run away from it.This is one of the best Disney's animations and I'm sure both adult and children will enjoy the story and music and won't get bored even if you watch it for a few times."
"Pure Disney magic","23 December 2010","3/10","Disney pull off another magical film with The Lion King. From great characters to superb music this film has it all. Despite telling a simple story Disney capture all the features and elements that make their films so beloved and loved. The voice cast is right on the money and the sentiment that can often cloud this type of film is subtle and emotional. If ever there was a Disney film that perfectly captured the spirit of pure family entertainment it was this one.This film was a huge success for Disney and catapulted them back to the top of their game which judging by this film is exactly where they deserve to be."
"Snores!!!!","20 April 2015","10/10","There are a million other Disney movies that are sooo much better than this one! This movie is just boring all throughout. Also,i felt it was too scary for children. It made my little cousins cry. The songs were bad in my opinion. I hated every character, and i really didn't care what happened to them, really i just wanted this movie to end! Disney is capable of so much more, which I saw in 2015 Cinderella! That Beats out this any day of the week. There just wasn't anything for me in this movie, very bland and boring. I really don't know what else to say about it, it was bland and poor! I'm giving The Lion King a 3/10 for being a poor attempt at a family film by Disney."
"In June 1994, Disney unveiled what would become one of its most beloved animated titles, The Lion King.","10 June 2018","10/10","From the stealthy array of talent selected to perform the voices, including such deep-tone stalwarts as James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons, one almost expects a tragedy in the Shakespearean tradition. And, in certain aspects, The Lion King does fit this bill. Instead of the house of Hanover or Stuart, the drama centers on the reign of the mighty lion Mufasa (Jones), the king of a perfectly balanced African kingdom of animals who thrive in stunning abundance. A beneficent monarch, Mufasa, raises his young male cub, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas, then Matthew Broderick as an adult) to know that ""we are all connected in the great circle of life.""But, even in this teeming ecosystem, there is rancor; Mufasa's avaricious younger brother, the dark lion Scar (Irons), plots to become king. He orchestrates a bloody internecine intrigue, killing Mufasa and sending the young Simba into exile in the wilderness.Essentially, The Lion King is a coming-of-age story as the young Simba grows and matures to a point where he is ready to reclaim his birthright and, more importantly, carry on the harmonious work of his father. While weighty in theme, and propelled by several remarkable moral lessons, The Lion King's screenplay (by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton) bursts along at a spectacular dramatic gait, nourished with light humor, tending romance and frisky escapades.Directors Roger Allen and Rob Minkoff, respectful of both the story's epic grandeur and personal power, have fashioned a radiantly multidimensional film.The crowning glories of The Lion King must be bestowed upon the legions of animators who contributed to its majestic, playful and glowing look. Composer Hans Zimmer's throbbing, percussive musical score also is a highlight, while the songs of Tim Rice and Elton John not only propel the plot but add cheerful zest to the splendid terrain of The Lion King. - Duane Byrge"
"Very good movie; Very good story; SIMBA OWNS","3 September 2006","10/10","Disney made another solid A in cinemas everywhere around the world in 1994 with ""The Lion King,"" a very nice animated film.It is about Simba, a young lion whose father was Mufasa, the original king of the Pride Lands. That opening scene where Rafiki broke open the gourd, made a mark on Simba's head with the juice and dust and lifted him towards the sun from Pride Rock is the most recognizable scene of the movie, because that's how it all began. As Simba had grown up, he had to learn about his issues in life, try to stay away from trouble (that scene where Mufasa and Simba had a long talk ""SIMBA, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU, etc."" TOTALLY taught Simba a lesson; after that was the whole ""Look at the stars"" thing), and later, as a wildebeest stampede, started by Scar, killed Simba's father, now Simba had to grow up all alone and try to figure this whole thing out all by himself.Later, Simba was lost in the desert with vultures and stuff, and here, enter Timon and Pumbaa. This recognizable phrase, Hakuna Matata, started to change Simba's life, as well as moviegoers', forever! Then we see Simba, Pumbaa, and Timon (with his funny walk) walk across the log in the night, with Simba becoming an adult! Simba then had fallen in love with Nala, and later on, when Simba was worried, Rafiki had come to him, told Simba to look in the water, and Simba decided to return to Pride Rock to become king.Pride Rock was a bad wasteland; how sad was that. Suddenly, Simba realized that Scar killed Mufasa, and so, they battled on Pride Rock with a fire below!!!!! Simba won, and all was restored, and that beginning scene? This time, with Simba and Nala, we see it again, and thus ends the movie.""The Lion King"" is a terrific film. It had memorable scenes, good lessons, and nothing but Disney Magic. I've seen this in the movies in '94 and the re-release in '95, we had the video for some time, and this played on the Old Disney Channel in the late 90s. Go watch it; I think your life will change forever.10 out of 10"
"it was a awesome movie !","29 May 2016","8/10","great movie i v ever seen ! and it I inspirational too ... love it <3 ;) the story is => This retelling of ""The Lion King"" is conveyed from the perspective of market Timon (Nathan Lane) and warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) and shows how the pair became friends. When Timon leaves his colony because he doesn't fit in, he meets the lonely Pumbaa. Together Timon and Pumbaa search for a new home, having adventures along the way and eventually meeting up with lion prince Simba (Matthew Broderick), who is in exile from his home and must challenge the evil Scar for the title of Lion King. really i enjoyed the movie very much and its a impressive movie also <3 i will never forgot these memories Most interest thing my nieces fab movie I lion king The Lion King was released on June 15, 1994, to a positive reaction from critics, who praised the film for its music, story and animation; it finished its run as the highest-grossing release of 1994. Following a 3D re-release in 2011, with earnings of over US $968 million worldwide as of 2011, the film is the highest- grossing hand-drawn animated film in history, the highest-grossing 2D animated film in the United States, the sixth highest-grossing animated film of all time, and the 29th-highest-grossing feature film of all time. The Lion King garnered two Academy Awards for its achievement in music and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. The film has led to many derived works, such as a Broadway adaptation; two direct-to-video follow-ups—the sequel The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998) and the prequel/parallel The Lion King 1½ (2004)—and two television series, Timon and Pumbaa and The Lion Guard.The Lion King is a 1994 American animated epic musical film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the 32nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The story takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa, and was influenced by William Shakespeare's Hamlet. The film was produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance. The Lion King was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, produced by Don Hahn, and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton. Its original songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, and original scores were written by Hans Zimmer. The film features an ensemble voice cast that includes Matthew Broderick, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkinson, Robert Guillaume, Madge Sinclair, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and Jim Cummings.The Lion King tells the story of Simba, a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as king; however, after Simba's uncle Scar murders Mufasa, Simba is manipulated into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile in shame and despair. Upon maturation living with two wastrels, Simba is given some valuable perspective from his childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny.Development of The Lion King began in 1988 during a meeting between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider while promoting Oliver & Company in Europe. Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment, and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers. Production began in 1991 concurrently with Pocahontas, which wound up attracting most of Disney's top animators. Some time after the staff traveled to Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya to research on the film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical, and was replaced by Minkoff. When Hahn joined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten. Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences were produced at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida. Computer animation was also used in several scenes, most notably in the wildebeest stampede sequence."
"It's fun, sad, and very funny","28 March 2021","10/10","I love this movie, The original lion king was a classic unlike its live action counter part."
"i love this movie","31 March 2015","10/10","Honestly I have a cousin with a mental disorder who would watch this movie over and over and at that time my mother was pregnant with me and ever since i was born i grew up watching both The Lion King and Lion King 2 and i'm 16 almost 17 and i still watch this movie like a thousand times. I love how they show us many different morals in life in a unique way; like when Mufasa explains the circle of life to Simba and how we are all one. Also when Mufasa explains to Simba that There will be a time where he has to leave (death) and Simba would have to take over. Mufasa also shows that it takes great responsibility to be King and there are moments where even the brave get scared. It also shows that when we're young we get carried away with growing up and we want to change things when we grow up but when we get older then we realize the purpose on why it was the way it is. Finally teaching running away from your problems isn't the solution because it will catch up to you (when Nala goes to look for food in the oasis where Simba had been living since he ran away)"
"As Good As It Gets!","8 April 2015","7/10","This movie truly is a classic and one of the best films I have ever seen, even after 21 years since its release. Timon and Pumbaa are hilarious and so is Rafiki the baboon.The story of growing up between Simba and Mufasa is especially touching and can teach a lot to us today. And of course, the jealousy and betrayal of Scar are themes that echo real life.And, of course, the fact that Simba and Nala have their own cub at the end is great. This movie has a great voice cast, awesome animation, a great storyline, and as with all of the early to mid 90s Disney films, an absolutely perfect soundtrack.Truly deserving of its tag as Disney's best film until Frozen, it will always be a classic to me."
"A true masterpiece! Of ""royal"" splendour","18 August 2011","10/10","It is everyday that you get a film. However, it is not everyday that you get a film that is original and inspirational. The Lion King is a perfect example of that for it's a masterpiece that I guarantee will entertain people of all ages! The plot is pretty straightforward, but I think it has creativity in every way. It follows Simba, a young lion cub who is destined to become the new king of the African Savannah, after his father, Mufasa. However, Mufasa's jealous brother, Scar wishes to claim the throne for himself and intends to kill both Mufasa and Simba, with the help of a dastardly yet comical pack of hyenas. Going into self-exile when told that he is responsible for his father's death by a planned wildebeest stampede (we all know who really did it, don't we?), Simba grows up while befriending the famous duo, Timon and Pumbaa, then is eventually persuaded to defeat his uncle Scar and become the rightful king. A plot such as this is so compelling, it is uncanny. As for the characters, each and every one of them is brilliantly made, and the voice actors are well chosen, my personal favourites being James Earl Jones as the voice of Mufasa, Whoopi Goldberg (well known for her role in Sister Act) as the lead hyena Shenzi and the fabulous Rowan Atkinson as Zazu, a hornbill and the king's majordomo. And let's not forget Nathan Lane as Timon and Jeremy Irons as Scar! The rest of the film is equally fantastic. The main reason I love TLK is that its characters are animals, in the African Savannah (I am a big fan of African wildlife)! For those who have not seen The Lion King, watch it! Now! I promise you will praise the film for all it's worth (made even better with its unique and epic soundtrack) and you will not regret watching it. As a conclusion, I give The Lion King a 10 and recommend it highly."
"Still Pretty Good","19 September 2021","7/10","Watching this movie again ever since I was a child was quite a nostalgic experience for me.I always loved this movies soundtrack, the songs and hilarious comedy that Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella performance provided for Timon and Pumbaa.So I'll always have a soft spot for this movie as it brings me back to when I was a kid and singing Hakuna Matata. However, if I'm being honest with myself, I don't think this movie is incredible as others say it is in my opinion of course. However I do understand the praise and why so many people still talk highly about this movie.Personally, I do think the story is okay (Not amazing) and some of the characters are just not interesting to me like Scar. Its not something that really connects to me as an adult compared to when I was a kid however its it still pretty good movie and I do recommend it if you haven't seen it.The songs are bangers tho.7/10."
"Long live the King","25 December 2006","3/10","This movie often reminds me of my childhood. The old times, then everything around was new and unfamiliar. And now I clearly remember, how I first saw it on VHS and was really impressed with whole magic Disney had created. Even today I think very well of this movie and recommend it to my friends, no matter how old they are. Few days ago I watched this movie again with my friends, although it was digitally remastered. Sure thing I wanted to see the classic version but nevertheless I enjoyed it very much. And so did my friends, They also agreed with me, what nowadays movies can't compare with old Disney's classics and I hope, that people won't forget them. It would be a great fun if all these characters as Simba from my long beloved Liong Kinng or Little Marmaid Ariel once again would be popular and famous as they were long ago."
"One of the Great Disney Films of the Early 1990s","20 November 2014","10/10","Tricked into thinking that he caused the death of his own father (James Earl Jones), a young lion cub (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) flees and abandons his destiny as the future king.Disney's strongest period in recent history was the late 1980s and early 1990s. They consistently released hits: ""Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin"", ""Beauty and the Beast"". The princesses from these films have taken their place alongside the classics (Snow White and Cinderella). Until ""Frozen"" twenty years later, this success would not be repeated.""The Lion King"" came at the end of this cycle, and did not feature a princess (at least not in human form). But it is still a great tale of loss, redemption, triumph. Many would place it among the top three Disney cartoons ever made."
"Self-satisfied nonsense","5 September 2014","9/10","All credit where it's due, on a technical level, THE LION KING is a very well put-together movie. The colors are vivid, the character's movements are fluid, and it's just a very pretty movie to look at. I give this movie a bad rap all the time, but even I have to admit this. My problem is that it's been unbelievably overblown for twenty years. Disney marketing got it into their heads that this is some sort of high prestige experience; bigger than all their other animated fluff, and warranting of blind praise from everyone. It's impenetrable for me because I haven't been able to listen to the soundtrack for two decades (and the movie's big on its music). 1994 radio was saturated with both the Elton John songs and the Simba numbers, and I haven't been able to hear any of it again since. For a musical, that's kind of a deal- breaker.Story-wise, it definitely works better when you're a kid. The characters aren't obnoxious and Simba's reckoning isn't shallow. But it's just such nauseating material. The whole thing's built on pomp and spectacle, but there's nothing underneath. 3/10"
"Greatest animated movie ever made, maybe even the greatest movie of all time","4 March 2021","10/10","The Lion King is an absolute delight to watch. I feel like it's the best movie ever made by Disney, and one of the best movies ever made in general. It beautifully portrays Hamlet in a funny and charming way and is told with some of the most beautiful hand-drawn animation ever produced. It explores the themes of self-identity, grief and honour in a beautiful and emotionally-destructive way. The characters all do what they're supposed to do without being too annoying or bland. Scar is an intimidating and terrifying villain who really packs a punch. The songs are all outstanding, my personal favorites being ""Hakuna Matata"" and ""Be Prepared"". It has some the most gorgeous score I've ever heard in a movie which makes the emotional scenes even more sad to watch, to the point where I'm just bawling my eyes out in a little ball on the floor. It's an important movie that everyone in their lifetime should watch, and I really mean it."
"A masterpiece","10 February 2014","NA","One of the most famous and beautiful Disney's movie. It's a perfect mixture of friendship, family, honor, reputation, hope and justice. Perfect for everyone, not just for children. I believe that each of us has cried in the scene where Simba's father is killed by Scar, and everyone rejoiced at the end of the movie when Simba gets justice. Each of us also laughed in every scene with Timon and Pumba. Two very different animals but this does not prevent them from being friends. One of the best lessons for life: Hakuna Matata, no worries.In my opinion the best Disney song of all time: It teaches us not to take everything too seriously and be free."
"""The Lion King""- An epic animated movie","18 June 2017","NA","The Disney's ""The Lion King"" is an animated musical film directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff and produced by Dan Hahn in 1994. This movie was basically an inspiration from William Shakespeare's Hamlet. The Lion King, in my opinion, is an epic movie with a full package of adventures in life. It is a movie filled with happiness, love, family, emotions, lessons etc. The movie is generally based on the subject or theme 'Authority'. In the beginning introduction song, we can see that the entire forest bows down to one true dedicated King, Mufasa the Lion, as we all know, Lion is the King of the Jungle. The movie tells us the story of a King, Mufasa and his son, Simba who is the next king to be. After an unfortunate incident happened to Mufasa, Scar his brother guilty Simba into thinking that he was the reason for the incident. This makes Simba leave his kingdom and run away from his family. The journey of Simba succeeding his father's pride land is the movie, 'The Lion King'. 'The Lion King' is known as the Disney's best ever animation film and I couldn't agree more. To begin with, the voices done for every character suits their personality. The king, Mufasa's voice describe him as a king- strong and ruling, his brother and/or the evil uncle's voice has the grudge, just as his character in the movie. Zazu the bird's character is more toward the funny side so does his voice. The softness and humor in Rafiki's voice represented his character as a caring, fun-filled well-wisher. The roles that each character of the movie represents have done a great job in acting. Since it is a musical film, the voices have higher expectations and I believe that this movie has met with all the expectations. When it comes to animation, it is important to make everything seem so perfect, otherwise, it is easy to point out the mistakes. In that case, this movie has done its best job. I believe that no matter how great the story is, it wouldn't attract or reach the audience if the cinematography is a failure. We all have witnessed the grand success of the film. I would like to talk about the two techniques that I admired about the movie: camera angle, camera movement of the film. Camera angles were extraordinary in this movie. Starting from introduction scene, where Rafiki lifts Simba to show the world that the future king has been born, the angle was so perfect that along with the song, it definitely gives a goosebumps moment. The camera movement throughout the movie was an eye treat to the audience. Especially during the songs, the flow in the movement will definitely make everyone want to dance. Overall, 'The Lion King' has met with all the requirements for a fun-filled entertainment package."
"An American Classic.","17 August 2009","10/10","The Lion King has always served as my all time favorite movie. It captures the childhood memories you long for as you continuously grow older. It's simplistic ability to entertain and provoke joyful feelings is something rarely found in movies currently being made. The lesson of believing in yourself, and overcoming struggles is important for kids to learn. It teaches one about the ability to trust, but also to know that this world is not perfect. The characters will leave your stomach hurting from the laughter produced, and the songs will have you singing. The animation is nothing to be overlooked, and its rather perfect nature will leave you in awe. There is no contest that this movie will forever remain a classic. A competitor for its place in the homes of America is almost impossible to find."
"An absolute classic","8 July 2009","10/10","This was Disney's B-movie production. The studio was convinced that the following year's ""Pocahontas"" was going to rake in the cash and the praise. However, armed with a story lifted from ""Hamlet"" and some of the all-time great Disney songs, ""The Lion King"" became the last great film to come out of Disney's hand-drawn animations, and the last in a golden era which included ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"". The young generation who grew up with this film have a level of affection for it that very few films have achieved. Their parents have a similar fondness for it. Now, some years on, that young generation can appreciate it as a family film once more with their children, but can also appreciate the superior level of craft which is in this film.From the breathtaking opening, the power of the songs is immediately apparent. ""The Circle of Life"" with the sun breaking across the plain is striking and iconic, for parent and child alike. The energy of ""I just can't wait to be king"" is contrasted with the scheming moodiness of ""Be Prepared"". ""Hakuna Matata"" is still adored and is delightfully witty (it has the most intelligent fart joke ever) and ""Can you feel the love tonight?"" is up there with ""Beauty and the Beast"" in the pantheon of great Disney love songs.The songs complement a story which is simple, effective and daring. Like many of the best Disney films, there is darkness here that the young viewer can deal with but gives the film added depth. The death of Mufasa can still bring the butchest teenager to tears. However, there is also a wealth of humour which ranges from intelligent and witty to absurd and hilarious (""What do you want me to do? Dress in drag and do the hula?""). Also, this is a proper story. The trials of Simba are thoroughly engaging and the world he finds himself in is richly populated by entertaining characters. The stand outs are the comic Timon and Pumbaa and Jeremy Irons's deliciously voiced villain, Scar (""I'm surrounded by idiots."").The film is also a fine example of technical class. It looks stunning – one of Disney's most beautifully drawn films – has a fine score by Hans Zimmer to accompany the award winning songs and was a major step forward in CG effects – the thrilling stampede sequence being almost entirely created in computers.This was a generation defining film, far superior and far more successful than ""Pocahontas"" (the VHS was the highest seller of all time). It was and is adored by millions. It has been somewhat forgotten, particularly after the advent of CG animation two years later with the magnificent ""Toy Story"". This film, however, deserves better as it is an undoubted classic to be enjoyed by young and old alike."
"Disney Classic.","19 March 2018","10/10","This movie has everything a great film needs, loveable protagonists, and evil villain, perfect music (won the oscar), a great message, great comedy, emotion and truly ground breaking animation. Iv loved this movie almost my entire life."
"The Greatest Disney Film Of All Time.","5 October 2013","7/10","One of the greatest films ever made, The Lion King is the very pinnacle of Disney's Renaissance Era that didn't just mark a creative high for the legendary animation studio but remains their most impressive work to date. An astounding masterpiece for all ages that's perfectly balanced in the smallest of aspects & still hasn't aged a day, this is without a doubt the greatest Disney film of all time.Set in the Pride Lands of Africa, The Lion King tells the story of a young lion prince who flees into exile after the death of his father when his uncle tricks him into believing that he is the one responsible for the king's demise. Growing up with two outcasts & embracing their carefree attitude, he is ultimately forced to confront his past after a chance encounter with an old friend & decides to return to his homeland.Directed by Roger Allers & Rob Minkoff, the film opens on such a grand note that its prologue alone is much better than most features turn out to be in their entire runtime. The whole story has an epic feel to it despite its grounded simplicity, the plot unfolds like a soothing breeze, the themes are handled with care, entertainment is top-notch and its carefully carved out characters add even more richness to the story.Each frame of its beautifully rendered animation is a work of spellbinding craftsmanship. Characters are brilliantly sketched too & do manage to express emotions amazingly well. Cinematography makes expert use of colour palettes & vibrant use of camera. Editing provides a frenetic pace to the whole narrative & is at its best during the musical numbers, while CGI is seamlessly integrated into its hand-drawn imagery.Although nearly every character in the picture has a well-defined arc, what makes them so much fun is the pitch-perfect voice cast that infuses new life into these characters & provide them their very own souls. James Earl Jones brings a king-like imposing quality to Mufasa, Matthew Broderick does well as Simba, Jeremy Irons is thrilling as Scar while both Nathan Lane & Ernie Sabella steal the show as Timon & Pumbaa with their impeccable timing & perfect chemistry.And last but not the least, I'd like to talk about its magnificent score. Composed by Hans Zimmer who was just starting out back then, the exquisitely arranged & masterfully orchestrated score elevates what was already an incredibly fascinating tale to such a grandeur level of epicness that even today, it remains the finest use of music in any animation feature out there. And further strengthening this aspect are catchy songs written by Tim Rice & Elton John.On an overall scale, The Lion King is an extraordinary blend of a highly gripping story, deftly written screenplay, state-of-the-art animation, cleverly drawn characters voiced by wisely chosen cast, terrific use of humour, skillful camera-work, tight editing as well as an outstanding score plus sensational songs, all of which work in seamless harmony in order to set an entirely new benchmark for its medium & effortlessly succeed.An emotionally stirring adventure that's full of heart, passion & creativity from start to finish, The Lion King is an unabashedly hilarious, occasionally melancholic, extremely intimate, thoroughly enjoyable, delightfully engaging, intensely thrilling, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying fable about life, death, identity, responsibility & resurrection that borrows from William Shakespeare's Hamlet yet is able to carve out its very own identity before it is finished.Marking the last great high for Disney's Renaissance Era that came crashing down soon after the advent of Pixar Animation Studios, The Lion King is a work of cinematic perfection that still stands tall & remains unblemished by the test of time and, for the epic this timeless classic is in every sense of the word, will continue to do so comfortably for a very foreseeable future. Absolutely worth your time & money, the crown jewel of Walt Disney Animation comes one hundred percent recommended."
"The Lion King is very good","31 July 2018","10/10","I just love this movie since I was kid in early 2000's.
So I have love about Bloopers, YTPs and more about it.That's all I can say."
"Excellent! Highly recommended! Wonderful for all ages!","4 January 2016","7/10","This movie will always bring tears to my eyes, no matter how many times I see it! It s a great movie, as for children and as for adults! I will not get tired to re-watch it. I have seen it like six times and still not bored. The moment when Simba's father, Mufasa, died, i could not stop from crying. The other movies, the following ones were great, but not compared to this one. This movie contains valuable lesson upon life too. If you have not seen this movie by now, you are lucky because it is a great movie and the quality time you will be spending for the first time you watch this tear jerking movie will be awesome. I took my 8 year old daughter to see the show. It was amazing. The cast was excellent. The way the theater transformed after different scenes was breathtaking. The entire story was captivating. We never felt bored or lost. From the opening to closing scene we were at the edge of our seats. My gosh I never experienced anything like this before. I would encourage every and anyone to see this show. It was such an amazing experience that my daughter & I decided to see at least 2 Broadway shows a year. The Lion King will always be special to us. Everyone involved in this spectacular production should be proud."
"2nd Part of The Film Where Simba Takes Revenge Could Be a Little Slow","24 July 2022","2/10","The plot of the movie is great. There is no doubt about this. An evil uncle betrayed his brother and become the king. Great plot. But our problems start from the 2nd part. They could show the brutality of Scar. How he has turned this beautiful pride forest into a hell. Also, the Simba we know is a weak lion. They could show us how our little Simba become so strong. They show the transition of Simba just in one song. This is not enough. So, the plot is great but the 2nd part is finished in a rush."
"I'm in the minority - I didn't like it","16 January 2006","10/10","'The Lion King' is a Disney animation about a lion cub named Simba who runs away from his responsibility after thinking that he is to blame for his father's fate. Along the way, Simba meets Timon and Pumba, the comical sidekicks. It's a sad film, but it is a film about life, and it is realistic in that sense. However, 'The Lion King' is probably my least favourite Disney animation. Although Timon and Pumba are supposed to provide the comic relief, I found the couple very annoying. Yes, this film had huge success in the 1990s, but I was never impressed with it. Most people seem to really enjoy this film, so I am probably in the majority for giving it a low rating, but I just did not think it was that good of a film."
"The only true king","24 September 2019","10/10","For me the original is always better than the reboot. But this has such an emotional impact. Great."
"Disney's best","29 January 2017","10/10","The Lion King has everything: Hans Zimmer's music, the delicious animation and the wonderful drawings, the superb acting with Mufasa on top and of course the great story this movie tells: it's about life and its stages, the hardness of loss and the difficulty in changing, it's about not running away from your problems, about believing in yourself, about evil, friendship, justice and love...In the 90s Disney movies got an unusual balance: the stories weren't yet the postmodern crap we have today and they had overcome the rancidity from before. The technology was still paper and pencil and the brand new technologies were just used to create epic scenes from scratch. It's not strange that from The little Mermaid (1989) to Tarzan (1999) it was Disney's second youth and just at the half of the decade they peaked with The Lion King (1994).If in 2017 we see Bambi (1942) as a timeless classic I'm sure that in 2070 people will see The Lion King the same way. And that is huge"
"Best American movie of all time","9 December 2015","10/10","There are too many good things to say about this movie. Even though it is technically an original story by Disney, I personally consider it the definitive version of Shakespeare's Hamlet. And they don't even sugar coat it that much. Not like in Bambi, where they just hint at the mother dying. Here you actually SEE the body. The characters are all likable, all the way down to the two best, Timon and Pumbaa. As a kid, I always found them incredibly funny. The villain is probably for me the best Disney has ever done as well. Scar really has that clever acting of Jeremy Irons and his interaction with James Earl Jones is extremely believable. And I real like the clever message it's sending through the scene with Rafiki and Simba. ""The past can hurt. But the way I see it you can either run from it or... learn from it."" The songs are all memorable, even down to my favorite ""Circle of Life"" and the animation is a brilliant combination of traditional with a little CG thrown here or there. God bless this movie. It is nothing short of an epic masterpiece."
"Heart Warming movie for all ages.","13 March 2018","10/10","""The Lion King"" is a classic movie that can be loved by all genders and age demographics. It's makes you laugh, cry, and want to sing along. The animations are just a stepping stone into the amazing movie magic that we see today on the big screen. Truly a movie that will be a favorite for decades to come."
"great film!","3 February 2008","10/10","The Lion King is a great film. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more. The message is very positive. There is a little bit of Hamlet in the plot. Previous films were routine love stories where boy and girl meet, know each other, fall in love and stay together in the very end. This film is much more than that. Simba is a young prince and his father is the King, who is respected and loved by all. The prince is next in line to the throne. He is innocent and naive and eagerly wants to grow up and take his place as King. Scar, king's evil extremely jealous brother, wants to be King himself, and he is ready to go to any means to get what he wants. Simba, along with his best friend Nala, is having a happy childhood - until one fateful day, where his father is cruelly killed by Scar, right in front of Simba's own eyes, hurting him for life. When Scar tricks Simba into believing that he killed his own beloved dad, Simba runs away, far away, never to return. He meets Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him some important lessons: Life is worth living. And Hakuna Matata - no worries. Simba grows from a small cub with a painful past, into a handsome and mature young lion. When Simba and Nala meet again after all these years, he falls in love with her and Simba's life takes a dramatic turn. It is a truly great combination of drama, comedy, romance, life lessons, and musical songs in a Disney movie."
"Lions","30 March 2020","7/10","Great movie. Great sounds track and some very realistic fight scenes"
"Undeniably a Masterpiece","30 August 2010","10/10","Probably what bugs me about The Lion King is the character design of the lions. Basically, everything I find visually engaging about lions is all but left out of the character design. Beauty & the Beast and Aladdin both had far stronger character designs, as indeed did many previous Disney films centring around animals. It would, however, be foolish of me to fish for any other faults that are simply non-existent.The Lion King is a masterpiece. Good story? Check. A royal lion cub who's a bit on the spoiled side sees his world fall apart when his father dies in a wildebeest stampede. Tricked into thinking he was responsible, he flees and adopts a life of ease with the carefree duo Timon and Pumbaa.This is some epic stuff. Though I decided not to include The Lion King in my favourites list of animated movies, my breath is still taken away when Simbaa sees those wildebeest run down into the canyon. That whole scene is one of the most heartbreaking scenes of cinema I have ever seen. There are real highs and lows here, a quality that most of the old Disney movies sorely lacked (and this coming from a big fan).Another big plus is the music. The soundtrack goes the whole scale. When all is well in Simbaa's life, there is hopeful music echoing of the jungle and the savannah. Then things get darker and the music gets deeper and more epic than anyone who's not heard it can imagine. ""Be Prepared"" is excellent and rightfully scary as the following scene testifies. The stampede score is one of the most ground-shaking pieces of music I have ever heard. When that all gets too much, there's ""Hakuna Matata"", the ultimate anthem for carefree living, to soothe the soul. Personally, Elton John's original version of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" (in the end credits) is the stronger of the two presented; I can hardly fight back tears every time I hear it. ""The Circle of Life"" set the tone for how movies should start and not for no reason. The whole audio part of this movie is a complete bullseye.The characters themselves, even if I really dislike most of the designs, are mostly very good. Scar is wickedly ambitious. Rafiki shows that wise characters can also be tremendously funny, and it's not for no reason that Timon and Pumbaa got their own show; they are wonderful. Equally great are the three hyenas. Then of course, there's Sazu (wonderfully voiced by Rowan Atkinson), the unfortunate bird who's the butt of the crown, no matter on which side of the family he's standing.With a stunning climax, soaring music and a roaring (sic), engaging story, The Lion King is a movie that hits every mark it needs right. It hits home with the audience and makes them feel for this world. It may not hit the mark with my aesthetic senses, but to pretend that the movie was lesser because of that would be foolish of me. The Lion King is a masterpiece, on par with the Beauty & the Beast."
"Not bad but not great.","28 April 2021","7/10","The Lion King wasn't really one of my favorite movies growing up, but I enjoyed it as a kid and you can't deny the great animation and great voice acting that still holds up. It's definitely a movie millions remember fondly of, and appreciate till this day."
"The Best Disney Movie EVER","8 July 2008","3/10","Out of all the Disney movies I've seen, The Lion King is one of the most remarkable films of all time. The story was touching, the characters were unbelievable, and the music was beautiful.The actors were chosen rightly for their characters & their personalities. Though the movie is rated G, some of the scenes my be too intense & disturbing for younger children. In this meaning, it is an outstanding movie, but in my opinion should be rated PG due to the fighting scenes and darkness of some death scenes. However, it's a great movie to share with the whole family. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be amazed! It's a classic for years & years to come."
"Its all right...","2 September 2019","10/10","This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I might as way say it - I enjoyed the remake of The Lion King (which I'll call LK2) more than the original (hereby called OG). Its possibly attributed to the fact that I saw the LK2 first, but even while watching the animated version, I felt it was really... choppy.Without the nostalgia goggles, as an objective viewing, its not that different from the remake. In fact, LK2 is more drawn out, with the story really taking its time to explore themes and characters. Compare this with the OG, which just bounces from scene-to-scene-to-scene without holding on long enough for anything to marinate. I suppose you could say that about most animated films, but once you have a live-action that actually explores more, its hard to go back.Here are a few things I did enjoy in LK2, which were missing in the OG:
The humor is better written, especially for Timon and Pumba. Most other lead characters have the same dialogue anyhow, so why bother comparing. The hyena antagonists are given more stronger plot threads as opposed to the OG,where they were just maniacally laughing. LK2 is also really beautifully shot; the photo-realism is a huge push in its favor.I will say, however, that the original music is way better. Songs like ""I just can't wait to be king"" and ""Be Prepared"" are bright and colorful,with such a unique charm, I found myself just pulled into the world. If the remake didn't reuse the original soundtrack, and focused on a more updated version, I feel it would have been a better film.I'll probably never see either of these films until I have kids, but I'm a little more inclined to choose the live-action story. Though the OG would have been amazing in its time, its definitely a kids movie going forward, as opposed to a more general-audience film."
"The Beginning of the End","1 May 2007","10/10","I am simply amazed at how much positive response this emotional hodgepodge has received since its release back in the summer of 1994. As a young teenager back then, I saw it opening weekend on the big screen and remember thinking that it was a very visually engrossing film. In terms of capturing realistic movements and sweeping scenery, the animation in THE LION KING had easily surpassed any of its animated predecessors, and for that I found the movie fantastic. As an adult now, I realize just how superficial my initial attitude toward the film was. If there's one thing that today's overabundance of CGI has taught me, it's that there's more to a film than just ""looking good"". You need story, compelling characters, an original and well-defined conflict, and, especially in the case of animation, an artistic hand with which to draw. There's no denying that many talented artists were at work on THE LION KING, unfortunately too much effort was put forth in animation achievements and too little in developing a solid story and a clever script. Like many other IMDb users, there's no denying that this film was adapted from Shakespeare's HAMLET, just as Disney's 1988 film OLIVER AND COMPANY was adapted from Dickens' OLIVER TWIST. I wonder why Disney did not acknowledge its blatant robbery of subject matter. This is unfortunately just a minor detail in my dislike for THE LION KING. This was, in my opinion, the first in a series of many films that signaled the deterioration of Disney's traditional hand drawn animation department. No doubt about it, they were in a definite slump in the 1980's: THE FOX AND THE HOUND, THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE, THE BLACK CAULDRON (ugh!), but with a fresh new crew in their animation department and a galvanizing reinvention of the formula for animated musicals in THE LITTLE MERMAID, it seemed that Disney had gotten back on its feet. Alas, THE LITTLE MERMAID, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and ALADDIN were merely Disney's Indian summer, for with THE LION KING came a completely new generation of animated films. With THE LION KING and its followers, viewers were bombarded with a predictable stories, numerous pop culture references, an obnoxious slew of celebrity voices, dated 90's pop songs, campy humor, and heaping spoonfuls of sugary melodrama. Don't get me wrong, many of Disney's previous efforts had many of the same deficits and only a handful of them would I consider near-perfect, but the animated flicks of old never attempted to sell out their audiences in the way that THE LION KING did. Yet somehow all of these flaws are what made THE LION KING the most successful animated film in Disney history. Call me old school, but I do not think that Walt would have approved of this. Since THE LION KING's release and the replacement of traditional animation with CGI, animation I feel has lost its art. I dare you to re-watch LADY AND THE TRAMP, BAMBI, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, or anything made pre-1960 and compare it to such 90's fares as THE LION KING. You will notice that the films today no longer resemble moving paintings as they once did and as was the original intention of animation. Still, my opinion of THE LION KING, as well as the rubbish that followed (POCAHONTAS THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, HERCULES...okay, MULAN was not bad up until its pop-music ending..THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE???!!!) seems to be the minority. None of these later Disney flicks were works of art, they were just another form of advertisement---predictable story with the feel-good moral of an ending, comic relief sidekicks, a pop song rolling during the end credits, etc. Yes, they all have very admirable morals (what makes a true hero???...it is important to embrace diversity...who's the real monster here???)but (gasp!!!) that's unnecessary political propaganda. Disney wasn't always that wholesome (Does anyone remember the Siamese Cat song from LADY AND THE TRAMP or ""What made the Red Man Red"" from PETER PAN?) and, even when they did take America's sensitivity into consideration, it never overwhelmed the entire project. Oh well, censorship is a completely different subject that needs not be addressed in this review. The point that I'm trying to make is that somewhere along the road animation was no longer considered art but simply cheap entertainment guaranteed to make money. And when I hear praise for films like THE LION KING for merely manipulating the general population with special effects, melodramatic plot twists, pop songs, and cheesy one-liners (not to mention lame attempts at comedy via ninja-fighting), I think back to when an animated film was not just a movie, but an idea, a seed, a creative project, an event, and and art form, and I am saddened."
"Not just some love story","3 February 2008","10/10","The Lion King is about a young cub, Simba, who is destined to be king of his animal kingdom. But his Uncle Scar has something to say about that since he's second in line for the throne. To prevent Simba from getting the throne, he kills Simba's father, Mufasa, and drives Simba out of the kingdom. Simba then meets Timon and Pumba who tell him ""Hakuna Matata"", no worries. But when Simba's old friend, Nala, comes to see him as an adult and tells him that Scar has destroyed the kingdom, Simba must confront his past and Scar to win back the throne!I believe this movie was a great tribute to all animation, and something that every movie should hope to accomplish. This movie I think is better than any other Disney movie simply because it is more ""real"" than any other one. It also has a lot more catchy music than films like Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. One thing that really gets me mad is the whole ""too intense for young children"" thing that's been said about this movie for the past 13 years. Little kids can deal with death, they probably don't even understand it. This movie i think really has mostly cheerful moments mixed in with a ""real"" story. Not just some love story with problems. It contains everything from romance to action, from happiness to sadness. You cannot get enough of this film. Disney sure has done a great job on this film and it truly deserves the title ""A Masterpiece."" It seems that animated motion pictures nowadays lack the true epic quality that makes am movie memorable and try to make up for that lacking in weird attempts at modern comedy that appeals to a young audience. Disney's serious efforts in producing something extraordinary as in The Lion King are no longer showing."
"Best Animated film I have ever seen","21 February 2008","10/10","What can I say about this piece of art that hasn't been said yet...? Maybe, why Disney has sold the soul of the animation art to CGI.This film will remain in history as one of the biggest successes of animation, why? You just have to watch the movie and you'll agree.As many late 80' and 90' Disney films the Lion King is composed as a theatrical musical. It's full of great music, that fits perfectly with both relaxed and heart-breaking moments in the film; Hanz Zammer, Tim Rice and Elton John did a very good work here.Voice cast is just wonderful, specially Scar, voiced by Jeremy Irons, is just one of the finest performing I have ever heard.Animation, flawless, beautiful, one of the best of history. A true example of traditional animation.Story is thought to be suitable for both child and adults. There are tons of cultural references; including associations, movie references, famous quotes, and very complex characters. I have done myself a very large analysis on the Lion King and I was surprised about how many things you can extract from a ""Kids movie"". Also there are many funny moments kids will enjoy and two memorable gags.As contras, I've nearly nothing about the film itself. Maybe the Kimba controversy... Disney should have admitted the influence; and the complete absence of important female roles that Disney is so used to. I've also note that the way ""bad"" characters are colored, some signs, are somewhat offensive as they are very stereotypical.My advice, this movie is a MUST for anyone. I have watch it over 10 times already and I'm not getting tired of it. You won't regret it!"
"Beautiful movie","9 June 2017","9/10","I agree with the above opinions, the film is a wonderful story about love and friendship. It is dedicated at people of all ages. The plot is surprising and interesting. While watching, the viewer can feel attaches to the character. Dialogues are very funny at times, but there are also sad moments that cause some tears. Ideal film for the whole family, but also for lonely evenings. Despite many years, animations in this film look beautiful and surprisingly fresh. The music used in the movie is also great. This movie has been a huge success for Disney. I think everyone should see him at least once."
"Spoiler","12 September 2015","10/10","This is the better film i ever see. I cry very much when lion die. i recommend this film for my children's and my little sister. Have the bests musics. My best character is Scar he is the Brother of Mufasa . Envious of his brother , dreams of taking his place as king ; with the help of hyenas, kill Mufasa and Simba expelled from the lands of the kingdom, becoming king but i don't like him because he is mad and did much harm to others lions he wants to be the king but fortunately he can no. I think everyone in the world should see this film, makes think of life.I think almost everyone who saw the film cried. But i really love this film"
"The art form of Animation at its Finest!","18 July 2019","NA","The Lion King is an artistic masterpiece. The combination of different colors and shapes portraying this Shakespearean story result in a cinematic experience you will not want to miss. All of the characters leave an impact on the audience through the beautiful character development and relationships. This makes the meat of the film engaging and heart-breaking.
Mufasa's death scene is sad, because we sympathize with Simba and his father's relationship that was previously established. Some consider it to be the saddest scene in cinema history, and I can't argue against that. When Nala finds Simba after many years of sorrow in the Pride Land, their love which was foreshadowed at the beginning feels deserved and romantic. Even as a kid I always found that scene compelling.
The main thing that makes this story and the characters work is the animation. Nobody would have cried over Mufasa's death if we couldn't see Simba's emotion portrayed in the animation. Every character is personified, because in animation you are able to do this. This is why I am not excited at all for the Live Action remake. You can't take away emotion from the movie and expect the audience to relate. Disney remaking their animated films in live action in general is not a good artistic idea. It is always a downgrade from the original, because you cannot portray emotion on inanimate objects or animals in the real world. That is why the animated versions are always better.
But in the end, even though the live action version will most likely be terrible, at least we still have the beauty of the original."
"A Masterpiece","19 November 2009","NA","This is an absolutely amazing animated movie, one of the best ever created. Who can say they didn't cry when Mufasa died. That is one of the most beautifully tragic scenes in cinema history. It is so great when kids movies include something that really evokes emotion and heart. Another classic scene is the final battle between Simba and Scar. It is a great climax to everything that lead up to it.Then there's Simba's birth and presentation. It is beautiful on the edge of the cliff in front of all the other animals. The characters are all great in this film and the soundtrack is one that everyone knows and remembers. I don't think I could think of another movie that has so many well known, original songs featured in it. ""The Lion King"" is rated in my top three animated kids movies along with ""The Brave Little Toaster"" and The Land Before Time"". It is truly a work of art."
"Great Family Movie","7 August 2011","6/10","This is a great family movie that takes viewers through and makes us think about the circle of life. It makes us think about how our choices affect those around us. It might bring up the idea of death a little early for real young children. Mufasa's death while tragic shows a father's love and what he will do to protect his child all the while showing how greed and the need for power (Skar) can destroy families (in this case the pride). Yes, it is cartoon form, and this takes the edge off the subject since they are fictional characters. Yet the subject is there opening up discussion about our choices and how selfish choices do gain us short term gain from time to time the choices to help others will benefit us for a lifetime. A great movie for kids and adults alike."
"a lot of hype but not to bad.","30 July 2019","10/10","This a good movie. There is better. But still a pretty good movie. No 10 out of 10. But still a 6 out of 10. This does have a good story line. It also has good acting. Good songs. It a good movie. For fun if you are a kid but still not bad. See it. It is no Godzilla. But it is okay."
"Childhood Gem","16 December 2010","7/10","Is there anyone who didn't love this film? Besides the one sentence/one-star reviews that always bring a film down these days? Probably one of Disney's greatest animated films ever, easily surpassing the many before it and many after it. The story is dynamic and much more involving than alas ""Cinderella"", ""Beauty and the Best"", and plenty of others that I not need say. Many Disney films seem to me oh so similar in premise and characters, this one stand s out as a truly unique and very different tale. And with the voice talents of Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan Atkinson, plus many, many others, the characters seemed much more human to me than the repeated after repeated princess in distress who is best friends with nature as well.how dull! And to think these are merely anthropomorphic animals, how ironic. In my humble opinion, this also Matthew Broderick's best performance ever.And as if having Hans Zimmer score the film wasn't a grand achievement in itself, Elton John and Tim Rice add to the score beautifully. The end result is a tale so epic if you look at it from a glance it evokes the scope of a Greek tragedy. In fact, amongst the many over-rated Disney Renaissance era films, this is one of the few where I can watch it again and again without ever tiring of it."
"bravo","3 July 2020","2/10","I have to start by commending the best part of this movie, and that's the musical score. not the songs, but the background music. it is phenomenal. brought ridiculous intensity to so many scenes. the songs are great as well, Be Prepared being my clear favorite.so many likable characters, even the villains. great story. very funny, all-around well-made. i have nothing bad to say about this movie. i really want to give it an 8 but comparatively it fits in with 7's based on my rewatch frequency. i also think i clearly enjoy aladdin (8/10) more than this one. will reconsider on my next viewing. (about 7 viewings, 7/2/2020)"
"This movie really is rubbish","20 March 2005","10/10","I apologise to all those captivated by the African landscapes and orchestral harmonies, but this movie is disjointed and shallow. The mass of names credited with the ""Story"" says it all - this movie is a bunch of disconnected scenes thrown together with absolutely no character cohesion at all. Some examples:Simba and Narla bicker and argue. They then sing ""Can you feel the love tonight?"" They then IMMEDIATELY continue to bicker and argue, and part ways.Simba goes from little kid to mature adult - Timon and Pumba do not age a day.After Mufasa safely brings himself and Simba up the cliff, he is then thrown to his death, and Simba never sees this as unusual or even wonder why.There are absolutely no male lions anywhere in the entire movie other than Mufasa, Scar and Simba - an entire tribe of Lions at pride rock, with no males at all.Timon and Pumba play absolutely no role in the plot, meaning or interest of the movie. They are shallow comic diversions that have no place being there. Their theme song (Hakuna Matata) contradicts the entire message of the movie, which is to live up to your responsibilities instead of ignoring them.Not one lion in Pride Rock EVER wonders what happened to Simba, and nor does the annoying bird Zazu, who was right there when it all happened - this is utterly ridiculous.Scar would never have simply admitted to killing Mufasa.After years of constant threats and derision, Mufasa is surprised when Scar turns against him, as if he never suspected a thing...I could go on for a long time. This movie makes no sense, it is too scary and murderous for young children, and it completely lacks any emotional involvement with any character. The young Simba is utterly arrogant, the old Simba completely distant, and his change of character totally unbelievable and contrived.Yes, this movie ""deals"" with many grand themes - it deals with them in the same way a food processor would ""deal"" with a 3 course meal - mash it all up into random unpalatable rubbish. Yes, the themes are there, but the movie has nothing to say about any of them, and they are presented in a completely disjointed manner. Comparisons to Hamlet is one of the greatest insults possible to Shakespeare.If you want a good kids movie, The Lion King IS NOT IT."
"The greatest animated family movie of all times!!!","8 February 2016","10/10","In comparison to every other Disney (which makes -in my opinion- the greatest productions in animated movies) film, is the top of the tops! Every meaning that tries to pass to the viewer is going right to the feelings, no matter the age! I think that it is quite educational for every person who watches that!Despite it analyzes an animal kingdom, you can easily locate a man society in which everyone tries to be on the highest level without calculating the other ones, no matter if they are relatives or friends or anything else. Important values presented in this movie such as friendship, co-operation, love, anti-racism messages and -of course- family! Last but not least, is the music of the film. I think is the most well-produced animated movie of all times and -even today- well-timed! 10/10 no doubts!"
"Nostalgia","9 December 2018","10/10","My all time childhood memories
Never forgotten
All time favorite animated picture"
"My favorite cartoon!","25 May 2016","10/10","My favorite cartoon! This is a story about family, love and friendship. As in life, is found in the betrayal, but good always triumphs over evil. And evil will always be punished. It is instructive cartoon. My children will definitely be watching it! Simba is shown here as a loyal and loving son, who so faithfully loves his father. I cried when Simba cried. Incredible sensations. I believe that such cartoons should be more. A lot more. It's not just a cartoon, it's the whole story! Disney knows how to create something wonderful. I don't know what else to say here. This cartoon was included in the era, and children of any generation will watch it with joy. I believe in it."
"The True Mane Event! The Best!","16 November 2008","10/10","The Lion King is easily Disney's most successful and entertaining film ever! Every character is unique in their own way. The Music is not of this world. Circle of Life is the song I want on my funeral. (Listen to the lyrics and you'll see why) Each song is so reminiscent towards my long lost childhood. For some reason, I Just Can't Wait To Be King excels most on that. Hans Zimmer score is the greatest I've heard in my life. Thank God he took the Oscar home! This film is most tragic to me, and uplifting at the same time. It's sad that Disney will never ever make a film just like this again. But hey, they couldn't even if they tried! So from the story, to the voice acting, animation, music, and so on, this is the GREATEST film ever!"
"The best Disney movie of my life...no one movie can top this...","27 August 2007","10/10","When i was 4 or 5 and the movie came out, i watched the movie everyday and i enjoyed it...Thing is, I'm deaf soi never understood the movie but i love ""seeing"" it and i keep thinking about it all the time and now I'm age 18... Last time i saw this probably 6 or 7 years ago so now the last 3 days, 13 years later...I finally saw it in DVD and i fully understand it and it makes it even more wonderful and extraordinary!! I swear, nothing can top this movie...I hope not...This is THE movie. It's a good-feeling/ emotionally feeling movie.Definitely 10 out of 10"
"The King, Has Returned","11 July 2019","7/10","What can I say about this movie that already hasn't been said? But I'll try. Simply, I believe The Lion King is the greatest animated movie ever made. It has some tough competition believe me. There's Wall-e, Toy Story, Spirited Away, Fantasia etc. But as an overall film, The Lion King stand above the pride.
The animation, is just beautiful. It holds up so well over 25 years later. Even in an age where 3D animation is getting better and better, the classic hand drawn look of the film never ceases to amaze me. The movements of the characters and the lush backgrounds are beyond superb and the entire animation team should be commended.
The characters are so memorable and lovable. Simba, our reluctant hero, must overcome his past and insecurities to save his people. Matthew Broderick is great as Simba as well. Scar is one of cinemas best villains. A great example of how a villain can be so in the wrong but also understandable and even sympathetic. His motives make sense, but his methods are detestable. Jeramy Irons captures all of that wonderfully in his performance. Mufasa, played by the amazing James Earl Jones, shows us how a monarch should behave. He's respectable and never takes more than he needs. He teaches his son to respect the world and the creatures who inhabit it. The rest of the cast of characters keeps us entertained throughout. Timon and Pumba are brilliant comic relief and Rafiki reminds me a lot of Yoda. He's a wise old master who helps our hero discover his calling.
The music is so great. Several songs are performed by The amazing Elton John. Tim Rice wrote the lyrics. While the songs are rightfully praised, the musical score by Hans Zimmer is one of the best in movie history, bar none. This is Lawrence of Arabia and Star Wars levels of epic music. It has so many iconic themes and it rightfully won the Oscar for best score.
It has a deceitfully simple plot, but once you unfold it more, you see the extra layers to it. The story has been interpreted in numerous ways, but I've always seen it as an allegory against unchecked and abused power. Scar is a dictator, through and through. Mufasa was a benevolent king who only took what he needed and, despite the predator-pray relationship, respected the world around him. Scar on the other hand, cares nothing for the people but only his own gain and glory. Simba realizes that he must stop Scar to save his people and return peace to the land. He has great power, so he must have great responsibility. He can't rule over the people with an iron paw but with a gentle and compassionate one. It's a story that resonates with me. I always find something different about it every time I watch it. Of course, you can interpret it any many other ways I'm sure, this is just my take.
All in all, The Lion King is a masterpiece of animated cinema. It is the Disney company's greatest achievement and is rightfully celebrated as not just one of the best animated movies ever, but as one of the best movies ever made, period."
"Fantastic, definitely one of Disney's best!","8 December 2007","10/10","This movie is extremely special to me and close to my heart, and every time I watch it I still get that lump in my throat when Mufasa dies. The Lion King is impossible not to like, with it's stunning animation, the well fitting voice cast, amazing music that will never be forgotten, and universal rating.Simba is a young lion cub, who lives on Pride Rock, and his father is the King, Mufasa, who is respected and loved by all. This makes Simba a prince and next in line to the throne. Simba is innocent and naive and eagerly wants to grow up and take his place as King. Scar, Mufasa's evil and extremely jealous brother, wants to take over Pride Rock and be King himself, and he is ready to go to any means to get what he wants...Simba, along with his best friend Nala, is having a happy childhood - until one fateful day, where his father is cruelly killed by Scar, right in front of Simba's own eyes, hurting him for life. When Scar tricks Simba into believing that he killed his own beloved dad, Simba runs away, far away, never to return. He meets Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, respectively, who teach him some important lessons: Life is worth living. And Hakuna Matata - no worries. Simba grows from a small cub with a painful past, into a handsome and mature young lion. When Simba and Nala meet again after all these years, Simba's life takes a dramatic turn. But will Simba take his rightful place as King of Pride Rock? Jonathan Taylor Thomas, the voice of young Simba, was very well casted. His voice matches with that of the feisty young cub perfectly. Matthew Broderick, who takes over the part of Simba as an adult, is just as good as his younger counterpart, if not better. I loved the voice of Mufasa, James Earl Jones, his voice is so calming and deep, and sounds wise, perfect for Mufasa, the ageing but immensely respected leader. Jeremy Irons as Scar is so perfectly done, ditto with Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. Timon and Pumbaa's voice overs were done with great finesse and very tastefully, and the voices and characters are very lovable. I thought Nala's older voice, Moira Kelly was miscast. The young girl who played her younger part was much better though.Heartwrenching and loved by many, The Lion King is one that cannot be missed."
"A great ""cycle of life""","28 November 2020","7/10","It's pretty cool. Although I admit Simba would never be good enough to even wipe Mufasa's shoes, cause he was the real king, with a great personality. Simba is alright, but not quite there yet.
Otherwise I guess it's a nice spin on the cycle of life."
"Best kids movie of all time","14 June 2018","5/10","This is arguably the greatest movie ever. So many life lessons to be learned from this movie."
"Fairly Overrated (Especially compared to other movies)","8 January 2014","10/10","This is a wonderful movie, I must say, overall, the best children's movie I can think of! But it's overrated, especially in comparison to other movies: shortly below The Lion King, is To Kill a Mockingbird, an American classic, while the movie is certainly not as good as the book, I can promise you, it is far more thoughtful, intelligent, and overall deep than The Lion King, that is just considering the story, but I don't think the animators broke any new ground. Contrary to popular belief this is most certainly not the greatest Disney movie, American Disney, kids Disney, yes... However, over in Japan, lies Studio Ghibli, I suppose comparable to Pixar, in its association w/ Disney. And they have made Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke,and be cautioned they are not children's films. And if you look online you'll find several people who can point out that several Disney movies are essentially just kid's versions of many classic and original Shakespeare plays."
"Hands down the most overrated Disney film, and one of the top ten most overrated films ever","23 April 2003","10/10","Best film ever? Disney at its best? Animation's crowning achievement? Well, I'm sorry to bust 99% of the world's bubble, but this is an EXCEPTIONALLY overrated film that in the past I would have thought good, but now think of as easily the worst animated ""masterpiece"" ever made by Disney.
It's plot is so weak, it can be summarized in at most one paragraph. Every moment is stretched as far as it can go, and more time is filled with irrevelant material, such as songs (which are some of the weakest ever created by Disney, but I'll get to that later) than with actual story. People claim this gives it an ""epic"" quality. The only way that this could possibly be true is through epic boredom.The characters are shallow and unmemorable. Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa, and the Hyenas are comic relief that are sorely missing comicality (If you want a truly great example of Disney's comical relief, look at the Genie and Iago from Aladdin, or Kronk and Kuzco from The Emperor's New Groove). Simba is an unadmirable hero who I couldn't care less about, and his love with Nala is anything but inexistent. Scar is one of the weakest of the modern Disney villains, and does not make you hate him like Gaston or impress you with his evil so much that you like him like Jafar. The only characters I can pass off as even half-decent are Rafiki and Mufasa.The music I will give merit to as being okay and somewhat enjoyable, but still, it isn't within a hundred miles of the attractive Arabian dances of Aladdin or the Broadway style melody of Beauty and the Beast or the fun Tropical tunes of The Little Mermaid. Only the Circle of Life (even I have to admit that the opening number is magnificent) is as good as any of the songs in the aforementioned films, and just barely. The rest are simply radio-friendly pop tunes.However, one thing I will stop at no ends to give this film credit for is its animation. I will say right now that no other Disney film has backgrounds so richly detailed or characters so well designed. Indeed, the art quality is definitely the most astounding ever created Disney. But art quality alone cannot save this movie from all its other weaknesses, and besides, art quality is probably the least important of the four major aspects of an animated film (the other three being story, characters, and, in the case of Disney, music). This movie does not deserve to be praised as if it is the best Disney can muster. The people who think this is true have probably never seen any truly great Disney films, or just can't realize one. Aladdin, for example, is in my opinion the greatest film, animated or otherwise, ever made (And I am a film buff, to those of you questioning my merits). Beauty and the Beast is in my top 10, and many others would probably crack my top 100. The Lion King, however, is depressingly mediocre, and deserves at most a 5. I give it a 2 only for the art quality."

"Greatest Animated Movie of all time","18 September 2018","10/10","This movie teaches how to fight and be brave. The emotions and bonding of a family. Its a classic kid movie. It is funny, serious and lighthearted. Age no bar movie can be watched by anyone and still can be enjoyable, with either a glass of wine or diet coke."
"Greatest Disney movie of all time","25 October 2015","8/10","Wisely said one of the greatest films of all time.... this Disney classic has won many awards because it's great. It has everything to make a good film. A setting, characters, plot, and an adventure that makes it the greatest, if not, one of the greatest films of all time history. It is a film that has horror, drama, adventure, comedy, and EVERY GENRE! The horror part comes from the terrifying deaths. But this Disney classic is the greatest movie that Disney ever pulled out of their pocket. I recommend everybody sees this amazing movie. Obviously the greatest film of 1994 and even possibly the best film of the 90's. It has no reason to be skipped or given a bad rating, this movie does have many sequels but they're pretty bad, this is the one you should be focusing on."
"Best Disney movie by far!","17 October 2007","10/10","Looking back on my childhood, The Lion King was definitely one of the best films ever made! Because it's Disney, it automatically has that quintessential cute factor, but The Lion King is also a powerful story. I love the theme in this movie - that while you cannot change the past, you should learn from it and take responsibility. The ending is one of the most powerful scenes. Even more, I love the characters. Who doesn't love Simba's courage (his childhood was definitely not ideal!), Mufasa's glory, Rafiki's quirky wisdom, and of course, Timon and Pumbaa's comic relief?I'll admit I'm slightly biased because The Lion King was also made in my generation, so I feel a certain connection towards it. But this movie really is the perfect combination of profound life lessons, humour, and entertainment. The songs are catchy as with all Disney, and some, like the ""Circle of Life,"" even have some meaningful lyrics. Also, the background music compliments the action in the movie very well. The voice acting is brilliant, with a strong vocal cast nailing their respective roles. Too bad Disney films aren't made this way now...The Lion King was definitely on the money."
"It's pretty good","29 April 2021","6/10","The Lion King is a classic movie. The plot isn't original, but that's not really a problem. It's good."
"My Favorite Film Period!","4 September 2008","10/10","I'm just going to come right out and say it, I think this is ""Sensational""! I grew up in the 2nd Golden Disney era, and while the other films were brilliant, The Lion King was the one that always stood out. It's profound coming-of-age story has filled me with joy and heartache. In fact the older I become, the more I can appreciate the art, script, and journey the filmmakers went through.The aspects of this films are excellent as far as I'm concerned. I'll start with the animation. It's stunning! The artists and animators alike went the full nine yards to grab the audience's imagination and put them on Safari ride. It's precision as well as colorful nature has turned the savanna into a combination of a documentary and fantasy.The music is a blast to listen to! Elton John & Tim Rice were right on the money. They combine elements of pop-show-tunes and moving ballads, so it remains catchy, fresh, easy, and moving all at the same time. The score by Hans Zimmer has been nothing short of splendid. It captures the essence within the first five minutes. The power and majesty of the score awakens the senses and even heart. And credit should absolutely be given to Lebo M for providing the culture and spirit of South Africa. Sirli all these very different of equally talented men into one project and you have something magnificent.And finally- what a remarkable cast! If it hadn't been for these fantastic men & women, we wouldn't have the characters with the same amount of depth or hysteria. Each actor borough a critical but top notch performance. And a standing ovation to them should be given. James Earl Jones, Jermy Irons, Matthew Broderict, Johnathan Taylor Thomas, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkins, Moria Kelley, Robert Guillume, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings should all be immensely proud to have been apart of this project.All in all this film couldn't be anymore entertaining to me. Filled with drama,laughter,suspense,adventure,romance and tragedy. It's become one of the most beloved and acclaimed thematic experiences. And it thrills me to know people around the world continue to celebrate it."
"The best","9 April 2003","NA","This is the best Disney animated movie ever!  I first saw this movie in the theatre when it came out and it has became one of my favorite movies.  I am 27 years old and I can still watch this movie over and over again.  I have a 4 year old daughter that loves this movie as well, but she will not watch it with me anymore because I know this movie word for word.  I was very excited to show her this movie and hopefully she will pass it on to her children. This is a movie that I hope will be passed on from generation to generation. The characters were great as well as the voices behind them.  Whoopie Golderg and Cheech Marin brought the hyenas to life as well as Jonathon Taylor  Thomas and  the rest of the voices.  I can't wait to share this movie with mu son when he gets old of to watch it. (he his 6 months old)"

"Unpopular opinion","19 October 2020","2/10","Okay, first of all I believe this movie is not a ripoff of Kimba the While Lion. There's a video on YT by YMS which goes into detail on that. Check it out before labeling this as a ripoff or whatever.That said, I did not like this movie at all. Perhaps it is because I did not watch it as a child and had no nostalgia for it. Or perhaps it is because I watch a lot of Lion shows on Discovery/Nat Geo, etc. and nothing depicted in this is at all realistic and honestly a story about an actual lion pride is much, much more interesting and appealing to me. Or perhaps this would have worked better with humans (Hamlet is what it is based on I believe). Or maybe this is just a bad movie?I did not connect with any of the characters even if I was to give in to the suspension of disbelief completely. Did not like the musical numbers, the story or the direction. The fact that Simba or whatever the main character is called gets it on with most likely his sister or cousin (lion prides always have related males as heads) made me sick. I suppose the voice acting of the villain named -ugh, really- Scar was fine (why did he have a different accent than his brother though?). That's about it. Don't get the praise for this movie at all. It was a total slog to sit through.That said, since most people love it, give it a go if you haven't, you'll probably like it."
"Absolutely Amazing!!!","24 April 2016","9/10","This has grossed $987.5 million worldwide. Considering it a better movie than the Wild. Anyways, let's talk about the movie. In the Pride Lands of Africa, a lion rules over the animals as king. The birth of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi's son Simba creates envy and resentment in Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, who knows his nephew now replaces him as heir to the throne. After Simba has grown into a young cub, Mufasa gives him a tour of the Pride Lands, teaching him the responsibilities of being a king and the Circle of Life. Later that day, Scar tricks Simba and his best friend Nala into exploring a forbidden elephant graveyard, despite the protests of Mufasa's hornbill majordomo Zazu. At the graveyard, three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai and Ed attack the cubs before Mufasa, alerted by Zazu, rescues them and forgives Simba for his actions. That night, the hyenas, who are allied with Scar, plot with him to kill Mufasa and Simba. The next day Scar lures Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there while he gets Mufasa. On Scar's orders, the hyenas stampede a large herd of wildebeest into the gorge. Mufasa rescues Simba, but as Mufasa tries to climb up the gorge's walls, Scar throws him back into the stampede, where he is trampled to death. After Simba finds Mufasa's body, Scar convinces him he was responsible for his father's death and advises Simba to flee the kingdom. As Simba leaves, Scar orders Shenzi, Banzai and Ed to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. That night, Scar announces to the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing a pack of hyenas to live in the Pride Lands. After running far away, Simba collapses from exhaustion in a desert. Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and a warthog, find him and nurse him back to health. Simba subsequently grows up with them in the jungle, living a carefree life with his friends under the motto ""hakuna matata"" (""no worries"" in Swahili). When he is a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reconcile and fall in love. Nala urges Simba to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a wasteland with not enough food and water. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off, leaving Nala disappointed and angry. As Simba exits the jungle, he encounters Mufasa's mandrill friend and adviser, Rafiki. Rafiki tells Simba that Mufasa is ""alive"" and takes him to a pond. There Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as the king of the Pride Lands. Simba realizes he can no longer run from his past and goes home. Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa join him, and agree to help him fight. At the Pride Lands, Simba sees Scar hit Sarabi and confronts him, but Scar taunts Simba over his ""part"" in Mufasa's death. However, when Scar pushes Simba to the edge of Pride Rock, he reveals that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba roars back up and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs Simba for mercy, insisting that he is family and placing the blame on the hyenas. Simba no longer believes Scar, but spares his life on the grounds of forever leaving the Pride Lands. Scar appears to comply, but then attacks his nephew. After a fierce fight, Simba throws his uncle off Pride Rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and eaten alive by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba ascends to the top of Pride Rock and takes over the kingdom as the rain falls again. Sometime later, with Pride Rock restored to its former glory, Simba looks down happily at his kingdom with Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa by his side; Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the inhabitants of the Pride Lands, and the Circle of Life continues."
"It places itself among the best animated productions of all time.","30 July 2019","10/10","Oscillating between big and colorful, the newest member of the Disney Renaissance marks a higher mark in terms of the stakes of the animation house, with a grand and epic story that possesses all the great Shakespearean traits, as well as the beautiful animation and the scope behind it, filled with charming, catchy and memorable songs, an amazing score, a worthy voice-casting and the best and unique elements every single animated flick should showcase, all in amazing-great deliverance."
"gooddd","21 November 2019","10/10","Love. great detailed animation. WATCH THE LION KING BRO"
"Loved it!","27 March 2015","10/10","I absolutely loved this movie. I've loved it since I was a child and I still love it now. Definitely makes me cry every time I watch it. Damn it. I love the concept of the movie and I love the characters. The characters are very different and each have their own personality. My favorite characters are definitely Timon and Pumbaa. ""It means no worries, for the rest of your days. It's our problem free, philosophy, Hakuna Matata."" I even re-watched the movie when it came back out into theaters in 3D! It was absolutely fantastic. I don't think I could ever get sick of this movie. Absolutely loved it. Emotional, thrilling (in a good way), and a great classic Disney movie."
"This is easily the best film ive ever seen","17 September 2019","10/10","And how surprising is it that it was made by the same company who made endgame, the remake however was a complete dumpster fire"
"The best animated movie!!!","28 April 2020","10/10","The movie is wonderful and full of emotion. A visionary triumph filled me with that Disney magic."
"The Greatest Animated Film I Have Ever Seen","27 February 2006","7/10","In 1989 Disney released The Little Mermaid and reinvented it's animation department. The peak of that reinvention seemed to end with Aladdin. But then in 1994 they released the highest grossing and most commercially successful animated film of that time. I have seen Beauty And The Beast, Aladdin, and Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. This one leaves them all in the dust. I first saw it in theaters at the age of six. My uncle whom I was extremely close to died a couple months before the movie came out. I had to be taken out of the theater. It took me six years before I was able to watch it without breaking down at Mufasa's death scene. Now I simply break down and cry throughout the rest of the movie. The film is incredibly deep, has an all star voice cast, and blends splendid animation with Oscar winning songs and compulsive storyline. You can't help but enjoy it."
"Overrated","18 August 2021","10/10","Film in my opinion good but very overrated. Cute at times but boring at others, the film introduces iconic characters and poorly written characters, a good balance that makes it beautiful but not wonderful."
"A Truly Epic Disney Classic.","21 April 2010","6/10","This amazing Disney film has all the makings of a classic. Great animation, excellent music, likable characters, and a great story. These are the type of movies I grew up with. I watched this film with my little sister a few days ago and it gave me goosebumps. This was Disney at its finest.It's sad however, for it seems that Disney's time has passed. Chicken Little, Home on the Ranch, Meet the Rbinsons, Bolt? These aren't necessarily bad films, but they are hardly on par with this film. The Lion King will be one of those classics that will stand the test of time."
"Did not feel so great","24 March 2019","2/10","The movie just felt above average.The songs was average and just a kingdom betrayal story.Not in the best list of my personal favourite animated movies."
"The Spoiled King.","9 August 2020","9/10","This is the most generic and lame animated movie ever made. Firstly, it's a complete rip-off of Kimba the White Lion. Secondly, on it's own it's still terrible. Scar is the most predictable and stereotypical villain ever - Selfish, dark looking, have scars, betrays and backstabs everyone, wants power. You could not make any more generic villain. Simba is so spoiled, he disobeys rules which have obvious consiquences, he do not have any responsibility all he cares about fun, until at the end of the film he takes the leadership. There are tons of songs in this film which makes it incredibly annoying and kills pacing. The story is very simple and weak. The only good thing about this film is humor. I suspect that anyone who claims this is the best animated film, has only seen Disney movies."
"Through despair and hope","26 June 2015","10/10","When marketing The Lion King for the first time way back in 1994, Disney made the brave decision to have its first cinematic trailer consisting entirely of the opening sequence of the film. It's a decision that highlighted the enormous strength and beauty of that opening scene where the animals of the Pridelands gather for the coronation of young Simba while the iconic Circle of Life accompanies his introduction. It's a gorgeous spectacle of animation and music which immediately grips the audience's attention and establishes the setting. The cell-shaded 2D animation of the wide range of animals combines easily with the matte painted backgrounds which add visual depth and beautiful scenery in likes of waterholes, mountain ranges, lush forests and waterfalls. The foreground and background blend seamlessly and the world of The Lion King is endlessly alive and breathing even with its limited selection of camera movements. It's at once more inviting than the relatively sterile 3D environments of some more modern Disney works (Big Hero 6 comes to mind). The film's soundtrack is similarly impressive. Elton John and Tim Rice combine to bring five original songs that still draw applause, recognition and sing-a-longs even two decades later. The opening Zulu choral vocals of The Circle of Life are powerful and evocative, while the animated choreography that combines with I Just Can't Wait to Be King makes for a jaunty upbeat tune. Hans Zimmer's score goes from strength to strength, drawing upon traditional African choral themes and percussion which resonates during the film's emotional moments. The voice acting is unique and enduring. The booming bass tones of James Earl Jones makes for a imposing father figure in Mufusa, in contrast to Jeremy Irons' Scar, rich with haughty disdain for his pride-mates. A fun filled exile in the middle of the film is characterised by that of the jovial Timon and Pumbaa, while young Simba's voice grows into the deeper tones of Matthew Broderick, during an excellent and colour filled montage over Hakuna Matata. The three hyena cronies of Scar are also distinct despite their ugly cloned appearances, boasting the voice work of Whoopi Goldberg, Marin and Cummings as the overly enthusiastic, sassy and hot-headed henchmen. The story is a simple if not effective one, drawing upon similar themes from Hamlet. It's a tale of Simba's quest for redemption and revenge after being falsely exiled for his father's death. The traditional coming of age plot is well paced and is earmarked by several deeply emotional moments, the most significant of those being Simba's grief at the realisation of his father's death (Jonathan Taylor Thomas's voice acting in this scene is heartbreaking). There's plenty of emotional depth in the portrayal of Simba through the themes of ostracization, loss, guilt and growing up which makes this film appropriate for both adult and children alike. The Lion King has a rightful place in Disney's elite as a vibrant, poignant and visually immersive film."
"Amazing Movie for all Ages!","4 July 2008","10/10","You truly have not seen an animated movie until you have seen ""The Lion King"". It is witty, exquisitely animated, and charming. The plot line is original and although I am well aware that it was copied from ""Hamlet"", as far as animated movies go, it was daring. Little Simba is absolutely the cutest animal ever, except for possibly Dumbo... While all of these factors have made it one of my favorite movies, there is one more that definitely separates it from all the other Disney movies, and that is the voice talent. James Earl Jones is wonderful as Mufasa as well as Jeremy Irons as the devious Scar. The bottom line is that you must watch this movie because it has a great message for younger kids, as well as a few jokes that children won't understand, for adults."
"love it","24 April 2014","10/10","I love this movie its very touching even though they are all animals the music scenes were my favorite as well the movie itself had a whole lot of suspense when the father died and his death was blamed on his own son who had nothing at all to do with the tragedy but his sly evil uncle was the one to blame he planned it all but it was very interesting when he thought that Simba was Mufasa and then the fight at the end was thrilling and the way he died was good for him.over all awesome movie!!! Hope they make more movies that will keep people or viewers wanting more. I believe that this is a great family movie to watch together."
"One of Disney's Finest and Set to be an All-Time Classic","25 March 2018","10/10","With a great story, great actors and Disney magic, nothing can go wrong . Factor in good soundtrack scores and what do you have ? An all-time masterpiece up there with Jungle Book, Mary Poppins and Fantasia."
"One of the greatest films ever made.....","14 May 2007","10/10","Now, I'm no Disney fan.Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Toy Story 2, Robin Hood at a stretch, and that's about all you'll hear from me about the evil corporation..........but I just adore this film. It is the movie I have seen more than any other. I know it backwards.Animation, storyline, voice-talent, music, characters - this film has it all. There seem to be no cracks whatsoever in what has to be the perfect movie.I know it takes a lot from Hamlet, but so what? At least the film takes itself seriously, which is something that cannot really be said for some of the animated garbage coming out nowadays.If you've never seen this movie before, watch it, and you'll love it. I defy anyone to dislike this movie - it really is that good.Sad, so sad, it'll reduce you to tears, lest your heart be made of stone. Incredibly humorous in parts. Touching, without being overly sentimental. Even now, the animation stands out.And to think, when this was released, it was seen as the B movie to Pocahontas. Pocahontas was a pile of pathetic tripe, and deserved only one viewing. The Lion King, an accidental hit, will be forever remembered as a genuine Walt Disney Classic."
"My favoeite","19 June 2018","7/10","One of my favorite Disney movies of all time. Always will be. Although I cry every time I watch it."
"The last GREAT hand-drawn animation movie EVER","5 September 2004","10/10","this movie is probably the best Disney movie ever. the plot is intriguing, never slowing down, and it keeps you interested throughout the entire thing.they don't waste a second with ""fluff"" in this movie, every minute is important to the plot. scar is probably the most evil Disney bad guy ever, and the story goes beyond the love/exploring the world cliché that other Disney movies are. this movie is unparalleled by anything Disney ever made.this movie probably marked the end of the era of hand-drawn animation. toy story came out the year following the lion king, and it ushered in a whole new wave of computer animation that will brush hand-drawn animation aside. after this movie, hand-drawn animated movies just went downhill in quality in general (okay, mulan wasn't that bad, but still doesn't even compare to the lion king.) think about it. all the good animated movies that are coming out now (finding nemo, shrek 1 and 2) are done by computer. it's a shame that there most likely won't be any attention paid to the art of hand-drawn animated movies anymore."
"Lovable lions....","27 November 2003","7/10","This was one of the first modern animated movies I had seen and I did enjoy it. I went into watching this thinking I wouldn't like it at all and did so that's a plus.I liked this movie in many ways. Obviouysly it was very sweet and touching and the complete aura of realism was there for an animated picture. There were moments I cried, the story was just so touching and I can see why this movie was..is.. so big.However, as much as I liked it, I don't think it was as good as Shrek(just my opinion-I KNOW many will disagree with me on this one!)Shrek probably makes my 50 top films ever. Lion King however was a major influence for me because had I not liked it, I may not have given other similar films a chance.One thing about Lion King. It was heavier then I thought it would be. There's some tough to watch scenes and I was a little surprised they'd be there in a movie that so many children would be seeing. I was expecting a much lighter movie but it was a beautiful film.However, although I wouldn't put this in the same category as Shrek(meaning, for me, I wouldn't necessarily want to watch it over and over as with Shrek) I'd still give it a well above average rating. Lion King was an extremely well done, moving picture."
"Disney of life.","19 June 2019","1/10","Disney has give us the best movie they have ever made. The lion king is a golden masterpiece thanks to its music, animation & humor. It will be remember as one of the best movies of all time."
"The Lion King - Some Nice Animation and Good Story Line","26 January 2023","9/10","Disney is used to making animated classics; but that should not diminish the praise they deserve when they occasionally rise above the norm in the genre on a yearly basis. This film exceeds the norm in several categories. The main character and his son are featured as the Lion King and cub, but the real backbone of the film are the funny supporting characters of the jungle, which include a snake, a funny boar, and a wise monkey (patented after the Chinese tradition of wise monkeys). Simba is a young cub. Who idolizes his father, and must take his place upon his father's death. The film highlights the problems of youth as they try to step into the shoes of others who have preceded them in life. It is not an easy task, and the film shows us why. Good entertainment for the whole family."
"Okay...but massively overrated","6 September 2016","10/10","The Lion King is easily one of the most popular Disney movies out there and perhaps that's because it was very popular with kids at the time and those kids who have grown up now still consider it Disney's best. It is a visual treat which underlines themes of love and loss. But people call this the ""adult"" story of Disney and honestly, I find it to be one of the more childish entries in the Canon. Yes, Mufasa's death is pretty hard for a kids film but after that, the movie just continues with a very childish tone. Take Timon and Puumba, for example, who are thrown into the plot to remedy the movie from being too heavy-handed.The scene where they're looking up at the stars and make fun of Simba is rather disconcerting - they literally just laughed at him for speaking of his late father's wisdom. Really? In general, the story is weak and really loses itself after Mufasa's death. The characters also weren't as good as everyone says. Everyone claims Scar is the best Disney villain....but all he really did was kill his own brother, that's literally it. Why would he send his minions to kill Simba when he's knows how unreliable they are? And when he is in power, he's just lazy. How did Scar gain the title of best Disney villain? Timon and Puumba are also extraneous to the plot just to keep the kids demographic interested. But the worst is Simba and Nala. Not only are they both bland and boring but the romance between them is rather questionable considering they could be brother and sister (or at least cousins). The music is fine but it doesn't quite live up to the works of Alan Menken and Howard Ashmen in previous Disney movies. The only two songs I loved were The Circle of Life and Be Prepared. Other than that, the soundtrack is somewhat weak. I just can't wait to be King is frivolous and random to the plot, Hakuna Matata has some very stupid lyrics and a whole verse dedicated to a warthog's flatulence, Can You feel the love tonight is a very syrupy song which just doesn't work with its very weak lyrics - ""Why won't he be the king I know he is. The king I see inside"". The Lion King can't seem to keep up with its own maturity. The fart jokes, the bi-polar tone of being serious and silly, the questionable incest within the romance....it all just doesn't work for me. A highly overrated movie."
"A truly beautiful Disney classic.","24 July 2011","NA","The Lion King spoke to me as soon as I saw it. It spoke to me as nothing less than a majestic adventure. Beautifully done on every level; from the music by Elton John or the whole story. I normally do not care for musical numbers, but these were excellent enough to draw me in. James Earl Jones does excellent voice work as Simba's proud and powerful father. It is more dramatically staged than any previous animated film and still remains a powerful work of art to this very day. Even amongst films in general, this one still holds its own as a classic and I think it will remain very powerful for a long stretch of time."
"A CLASSIC Disney MOVIE","9 September 2015","NA","I watched this movie at the theater when I was 6 years old and I am now 25 years old. This movie is one of the select movies that will truly stand the test of time. The storyline is truly captivating. Disney always makes such quality movies, but this makes you think very deeply about life. I will pass this film down to generations to come. The characters are so well thought out and there is humor, grief and integrity all rolled into one. To anyone that has not watched this, please do ensure to watch this Disney classic. You will be captivated throughout the entire duration. A soulful, yet effervescent delight."
"A timeless classic... a truly magnificent achievement of the art of making movies","31 August 2010","10/10","I first watched The Lion King when I was just a small child and I absolutely loved it. But it's now, in my mature years, I realize what an amazing movie it is, not just in the animation category but overall.The blend of the great storyline, amazing visuals, moving scenes (Mufasa's death scene still gets to me to this day and Mufasa appearance in the clouds talking to Simba was epic), enchanting music, and colorful characters is truly an achievement that is almost never seen these days....I recommend The Lion King to all ages, everyone on earth must be able to experience this landmark of a movie where not one moment is dull, no eyes will be dry, and no one won't get the ""chills""."
"The Best Movie Ever!!!","18 January 2014","10/10","If I'm only able to choose one movie to carry with me when the world ends, This Is It! The Lion King contains a great number of excellent elements; its story, characters, and music are all phenomenal. And the most important of all, it shows us what bravery, love, friendship, and loyalty are through a impressive, touching, and funny way. This is the movie you can use to teach your children what's really vital in their lives, and you can also watch it again and again when you grow up as well, even when you're 90. Believe me, you'll still find countless fun in it. Hakuna Matata!"
"The Lion King is a movie about a young lion prince who runs away from home, but who returns as an adult to save the lands from the claws of an evil new king.","2 August 2015","10/10","The Lion King will forever be my favorite Disney movie.The scenes can be very emotional at times, the scenes can make you smile and laugh, the scenes can make you cry. This is the only movie that has gotten me to bawl my eyes out, and that's saying something because I rarely ever cry. The movie also shows some romantic scenes, but, for once, the two individuals knew each other as kids and don't fall in love at first sight, they already loved each other and they admit it to each other at that point. The movie shows many funny scenes, and some can give great inspiration if you want some new comebacks to use in real-life -cough couch- the hyena scenes. There's also a lot of singing in this movie, but, really, who doesn't love singing wild animals?This is also a family movie, so you can sit down as a teenager with your grandparents or as a parent with your younger children, and it's certain that everyone will enjoy the film.I recommend this movie for everyone, as well as its sequel! <3"
"A young Lion comes into his own","23 April 2016","10/10","This film remains one of my very favorites. The journey of loss, growth and redemption plays out extremely well. Love it even to this day.If you have young children, you probably know the plot but I will not spoil that in this review. The voice actors are awesome in their delivery and really drives the emotions home. The story is not an original trope, but it still holds well in the test of time. If you haven't seen this film in a while, you should check this out with a new generation of fans. This movie makes for a good family night film or a good conversation piece among a group of film and animation enthusiasts. Again, a great film for the whole family. Enjoy and ""Hakuna Matada"" I think that's right."
"Just some thoughts on Scar (possible spoilers)","1 January 2004","7/10","This is probably why J.R.R. Tolkien was so against the use of allusions: has anybody noticed paradox of making Scar--through a song and dance routine, no less!--a Hitler-figure?  If he were really akin to Hitler, wouldn't he be creating a scapegoat race--or in this case, a scapegoat species--and run around killing all of them (or more likely having them killed) for the sake of the purity of the species?  Instead, he makes an agreement with the hyenas--who are hated by everybody in the pure Prideland--and actually honors his promise to them until the tide finally turns so far against him that he has no other way to survive than to finally make them the scapegoat. Also, Hitler was a great propagandist (I mean that in the most derogatory way possible), and I'm sure he built up the hatred against the Jews/gays/blacks/gypsies/etc. for a number of years before the genocides actually started.  As a propogandist, Scar makes a lousy Hitler (again, spoken sarcastically): he brings in the SS hyenas immediately, as if he expected them to suspect his murder of Mufasa and retaliate against him; instead (though in the script they don't) everyone should have suspected him, as his little speech and the sudden appearance of the hyenas could only have been planned well ahead of Mufasa's death (*smack*smack*smack* quick round of knocking the lions' heads together for their stupidity).  Someone as slick as Scar is supposed to have been should have known better than that; it is only the sheer dumbness of the lions and their supposed fear of the pitiful little hyenas that allows his assassination/coup to come off without a hitch. Going along with that, Scar is portrayed as being far too obviously evil, so much so that it's hard to believe nobody but Mufasa and Simba though that he was power-hungry and back-stabbing before he murdered Mufasa (though if Mufasa didn't realize it during the confrontation scene after Simba's ceremony, then somebody needs to have smacked him upside the head and yelled, ""Duh!"").  I suppose you could call that a gaping plot hole (or at least a major lack of good judgment of character) that Mufasa would expect for his brother to help him.  Obviously, Scar is meant to be a Shakespearean-type villain, like Ursula and Jafaar before him, but he is really too lacking.  NEWS FLASH TO DISNEY: Yes, Shakespeare's villains are obvious to the audience, but that's because there were scenes where their deceptions are revealed only to the audience, not to the characters being deceived!At least Ursula made her snide comments under her breath in asides.Besides Scar, a great movie.  Look for his amusing cameo in Hercules--a fate worthy of Hitler."
"Would recommend","29 September 2018","10/10","Really good and entertaining, especially for children"
"Fantastic Animation (with a capital ""A"").... Superb voices!","17 March 1999","7/10","For sure I am a Disney-fan. But perhaps I don't like the enormous media hype which is there whenever a new Disneyanimation hits the cinemas.The power of this movie is that it's both for kids and adults. And because I am a bit of both! I had the time of my life! DO BELIEVE THE HYPE!"
"It's No Toy Story","22 February 2022","2/10","Hard to believe Disney could make a film this bad a year before releasing Toy Story.The characters have no depth. The hero is a loser. Sure, movies like Aladdin portray the hero as conflicted and imperfect but Simba consistently fails and never demonstrates inner good.The songs are forgettable, and start predictably. And oddly whenever there is a song the full color goes away and becomes all yellow and orange or all dark. What is already a cartoon becomes even more cartoony.Most movies of this type have the main character experience a series of adventures, building to a climax. This one is missing that build-up. Not only that but it has the main character facing death - DEATH - time and again. I would not allow a child to see this, even if the parent could endure it.On the plus side the life lesson of the ""circle of life"" with carnivores shown eating actual meat is refreshing as compared with other Disney films trying to convert animals to vegetarianism.Much of the film looks gloomy and dingy - like some of the dystopian films where they de-saturate the colors. I watched it in 3D on a 65"" screen and was disappointed in the view.I paid for my copy of the film. I will be re-selling it."
"The epitome of a masterpiece.","16 February 2008","10/10","I am one of those teenagers who grew up in the time of Lion King, and back then I totally enjoyed it. But, having just seen it recently, I feel as if I must write this review. While not considering myself a movie buff, I have seen plenty of movies on AFI's top 250. However, even after seeing some of the best movies of all time, none of them compare to this one. (Biased) This is the best movie of all time, and let me explain. It expresses emotions that no other movie does, and because it is an animated children's movie, it is innocent while doing so. And I don't think anyone can disagree to the fact that the voice acting is loaded with talent, or the fact that the opening song is the most memorable of all time. The animation is fantastic, and HAND DRAWN! No matter how good computer animated films are, they will never achieve the 2D masterpieces Disney had in the 1990s. And this one is the most masterful of all, without a doubt. In a time of movies mostly about immoral behavior, and when the ethics of America are crashing down, we must all go back to happy days of our youth, with the Lion King."
"All time favorite","17 October 2016","10/10","This is a must watch movie if you have not seen or heard about it!! Grew up with it. Laughed, cried, trembled as a kid. ^ still do that as an adult ha ha... WATCH OR BUY THE MOVIE!! I don't know what else to type because it is so amazing and the plot is full of (I don't want to spoil it) you'll love this movie. I have re watched this movie over 78 times to be exact. I have one DVD for this movie in my friend's house, three in my house (two for backup), one in my grandparents' and I am a crazy fan for this movie so please do not judge ha ha. The Lion King as a whole is a movie for you if you like to watch movies about growing up and authority in the real life world."

"Brilliant Musical","26 November 2016","7/10","This film is not only an incredible narrative but a wonderfully brilliant and imaginative score that puts this musical at number one permanently. Each character has been thoroughly fleshed out and that is very satisfying for an animated film. It seems The Lion King created the landscape in which all animated features were to be based off. The film captures the African culture and the importance of the pride lands in this beautiful representation of wild life and the circle of life. From its rich visuals, and incredible music from Elton John and Hanz Zimmer there will never be a musical that nearly reaches this epic animated film.It will be hard to ever reach the success and popularity of The Lion King. But what this film has done is created a breathtakingly beautiful narrative that many generations to come will enjoy and learn from."
"I'm Supposed To Hate Disney Movies...","15 June 2003","10/10","...but not this one.  The Lion King is Disney at its family-oriented BEST! This is one of its few films in recent decades that belongs with its classics!  The animation is great, the voice-acting superb, and the characters...well, quite animated!  Don't just rent this one, it's a keeper."
"Never Listen to Your Sketchy Uncle","14 October 2015","7/10","The story opens well and makes you begin to care for the animals who live at Pride Rock. You feel like Symba is kind of spoiled (even though there are only 3 male lions in all the Pride Lands). The story introduces Nala and Symba's relationship as ""just friends"" which we all know that in a Disney Movie it means they will get married by the end. When Mufasa died, the world cried. Next, the third male lion takes over Pride Rock (since no other males are there to challenge him.) Symba has been forced to live with two hooligans in the wild growing up eating bugs. That is not healthy for a growing lion. He needed real meat, which is probably why Symba was a lot smaller than his dad. When Symba finally comes back, him and the lionesses fight with an army of thousands of hyenas, somehow winning. But who cares! Scar is eaten alive for his betrayal of the hyenas and eventually the damage of years of drought and fire and famine are replaced in a very short amount of time. They all lived happily ever after. The movie The Lion King was an excellent movie that could be watched many times over. It gave amazing life lessons, like how to find who you are and never to listen it your sketch uncle. Over all this movie can emotionally move pretty much everyone, if it doesn't then you likely have no soul."
"It's not easy to be king.","6 July 2020","3/10","The story of courage and growth, even after many years, even in different times, can still make people feel. Simba has embarked on the road to kingship in the twists and turns of life."
"Un\satisfying New Age Baloney","13 October 2006","10/10","Rarely have I watched a ""kids"" or ""family"" animated full-length movie and felt so unsatisfied, finishing the viewing with a frown on my face. This didn't happen the first time; just on the second and third looks. The film just got worse the more I watched it.Maybe I got more culturally aware. I saw how much New Age baloney was thrown into this film, with Elton John singing about the ""circle of life,"" and a bunch of other more subtle Left wing propaganda that is typical of the Disney company.The villain, and even the little hero, became more annoying in multiple viewings. Once again, the more I watched this, the more unappealing both the characters and the story became, not just the ""theology."" Nothing in the story is boring, however. The characters are interesting, from the lions to the hyenas to the warthog and his buddy (who provide most of the comedy in here.) The graphics are top-notch with some of the animation - especially in the beginning - just gorgeous."
"Love this movie","7 October 2019","10/10","My favorite childhood movie! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a classic Disney movie to watch. Can never go wrong with The Lion King."
"Best Disney Film Ever","13 December 2015","10/10","I remember watching this when I was 3 on VHS. It was the best. Although, I didn't quite get the whole Mufasa death till I was maybe 7 or 8. Now Every time I re-watch it, it makes me cry. It also depresses me on how Simba thinks it's all his fault. But then he grows up and Nala finds him. She tells him what Scar has done to Pride Rock,Simba becomes all fierce and sexy. Then Simba goes back with Nala and brings Timon and Pumbaa with him. The diversion that Timon and Pumbaa create is hilarious. If I could watch it on VHS again, I would. Also if you're looking for a Disney film for a younger child, I would suggest this one."
"One of the best animated films of all time","14 June 2018","10/10","I have been watching this film since I was very young and I still enjoy it very much to this day and will never get bored of it! The film manages to fulfil everything you could hope for in an animation film: great visuals, catchy songs, likeable and memorable characters, a villain that you love to hate,unexpected plot twists and more! The Lion King is an amazing film for everyone even those who tend to stay away from animated films. If you haven't watched it already please do! Disney did a fantastic job on this one."
"Best Disney movie ever!","9 February 2016","10/10","This is my favorite Disney animated movie of all time. The opening scene with all of the animals and ""The Circle of Life"" is breathtaking. Right from the start you want to know the story of the adorable baby lion. It has very memorable characters including Simba of course, and Timon and Pumba are hilarious sidekicks. As a child I remember being frightened by the villain, Scar. The music is by far the best part of this movie. After all these years, I can still sing along. ""Hakuna Matata,"" which means no worries, will be a favorite for many. I use ""Can you feel the love tonight?"" as a lullaby for my baby. I recommend this movie to all families with children 5 and up."
"A movie I've loved since I could tie my shoes.","24 November 2008","10/10","First off, I have to admit that this review will most likely be peppered with sentiment and generational bias, as this was the very first film I was ever exposed to. I was a total child of the '90s (indeed, sometimes I still say ""NOT!"" at the end of a sentence not (pun intended, sorry)), and one of the fondest memories I have from that period in my life was when my dad took my brother and sister and I to see The Lion King on the big screen in 1994, when I was only six years old. Although my memories of that experience are obviously now only very feint (about the only parts of the film I can recall from that screening are the Hakuna Matata scene and the stampede), The Lion King is a movie that has practically become part of my life.Influenced heavily by Shakespeare's Hamlet, The Lion King follows the adventures of Simba (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a lion cub and Matthew Broderick as an adult lion), a curious and mischievous lion cub who ""just can't wait to be king."" Framed for the murder of his father Mufasa (the commanding voice of James Earl Jones) and exiled from the Pride Lands by his jealous and power-mad uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons, voicing the kids' movie villain that has plagued the nightmares of more children than any other since the Wicked Witch of the West), Simba escapes to a rainforest paradise inhabited by Timon the meerkat (Nathan Lane, pricelessly hilarious) and Pumbaa the warthog (Ernie Sabella). However, destiny calls thanks in part to a reunion with childhood best friend Nala (voiced by Niketa Calame as a cub and Moira Kelly as a lioness), and Simba gallantly returns to the Pride Lands to at last confront his sins and take his rightful place as King of the Pride Lands.The Lion King is, without serious rivals, my absolute favourite animated film of all. And the reasons why? Firstly, the afore-mentioned nostalgic significance. But it goes much deeper than that. When I was a boy, I was completely oblivious to all the actual themes in the film, such as courage, loyalty, redemption and facing one's sins (although over the years it did teach me to learn from my mistakes). Now, as a far more experienced and worldly 20-year-old, I can watch The Lion King back and  with now recognizing and understanding those themes, and seeing how ambiguously and intricately they're woven into the plot, so they're not shoved down the viewer's throat  I now know and appreciate what a rare film The Lion King really is.On top of that, the traditional animation holds up very well against the now-dominant form that is computer animation, the screenplay by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton is resplendent with by turns exuberance, humour, emotion and timeless and universal themes of the heart, and the soundtrack  powered by those amazing Elton John/Tim Rice standards ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" and ""Circle of Life"" and Hans Zimmer's mouth-watering score  is second to none. Don't get me wrong, most other works in the Disney cannon are great, but this one will forever the jewel in the crown in my eyes. And I still have the VHS tape. And cry when Mufasa dies. And know all the words to every song.Thanks for the memories, Rob, Roger and co. The Lion King is one that movie that I'll certainly be introducing my kids to someday."
"Lovely lovely movie","1 December 2007","NA","Writing about this film brings with it a feeling of nostalgia for times gone by. This was in fact the very FIRST movie that I watched on the big screen; way back in 1994. I can still recall the awe and the wonder I had when I sat in the rows (somewhere in the middle I think) and looked up at screen. Ah, the good old days...Anyway, to cut to the chase, the movie itself is a triumph and one of the best animated movies that I've seen. While the story itself is essentially about the eventual triumph of good over evil, this hackneyed theme does not stop the story from being poignant or touching. In fact, one might say that that it actually serves as the moral for a story that after all was aimed at children. The central character of the movie is Simba, the baby cub of Mufasa, the king of the lion pride. The movie begins with his birth and unfolds as we watch Simba mature from a young cub to a youthful lion (the transition occurring in the wilderness after his evil uncle Scar kills off his father). The movie concludes with Simba regaining his rightful place in the ""circle of life"" and becoming a father himself (after an epic fight with Scar. The battle was one of the best scenes of the movie. Extremely Powerful.) And as far as the animation goes, everything is top notch. The songs of the movie were hit songs with ""Hakuna Matata"" becoming a sort of an anthem for a while, I think. All in all, a great movie that should be watched, if only for its songs and some scenes."
"Lion King 3D","2 October 2011","7/10","Lion King 3D The Lion King is a movie that leaves you awing. This movie is where you can take your kids and family to watch it. This movie is for all ages. When watching it in 3D you feel as if you're actually in it. It is a movie that leaves you happy. The colors in the movie were fantastic. They were very clear and colorful. The plot of the movie is extremely grateful. Also the animation is very vivid. When watching it with a family it brings the family close to each other. I was very pleased with watching this movie. It was beyond great. I would rate this movie five stars. This movie is about a group of lions that all are family in a way. The King has a son which hopes to be like his father. The Kings brother is very angry that he is not going to be king some day. The uncle of the baby lion tricks the baby lion into trying to kill his father who is king. When the uncle kills the King, he blames the son of the King. The uncle tells him to leave and never come back. As the baby lion grows up he runs into one of his old friends. She tells him what has happened to their land. So then he must go back and save their land. He returns and saves his land."
"""Slimy, yet satisfying.""","4 April 2001","10/10","Okay that's a bit of an unfair quote, as The Lion King is that rarest of beasts: a really good Disney movie. Packed with all the formula highs of past successes (including, Bambi-style, the bizarre kiddie favourite of a murdered parent. What does that say about infant psychology?), yet its sentiment tempered with an Eastern outlook, this is a worthwhile picture.Cute, but never so that it's twee and self-conscious like most of the studio's output, the animation is more sophisticated than the now-creaky ""classics"", yet it steers clear of the more angular, abstract pieces of late. This is a traditional cartoon, and all the better for it. If there's a complaint then it's perhaps the too-brief running time, stretching to little over eighty minutes. This is particularly evident when Simba grows from cub to lion within ten seconds, though the film does contain the requisite three acts.Some great vocal characterisation (Whoopi Goldberg's hyena even strangely looks like her), but I'm not sure about Scar though. So named because he's facially disfigured, he's also darker than the other lions, complete with black mane and has an English accent. Three Hollywood villain stereotypes for the price of one. Though as the voice in question belongs to the superb Jeremy Irons this isn't too much of an issue, and he does meld the film with a darker element. In particular the (delightful, mind) SS symbolism of Scar's army during the best song, ""Be Prepared"". The reference would be lost on the child audience, so it's pitched to the adults. I wonder how many holocaust survivors would find this in good taste?There are some decent jokes, many puns on the nature of lions  ""As far as brains go, I got the lion's share""; ""I'm gonna be the mane event""; ""my words are a matter of pride""  and ""What's eating you?"" ""Nuthin', he's at the top of the food chain."" The rite of passage plot is as generic as the majority of the songs, yet both are loveable in context. I don't know if Buddhists would approve of their philosophies being transformed into Mickey Mouse morals and tracks by Elton John, but it still works in a naive way. Odd too how the lions accept the nature of karma and respect for all animals. Whenever I watch a Richard Attenborough show they're always tearing out zebras' hearts with their bare teeth. Still, I suppose they had to keep it a U certificate somehow...Some movie referencing combined with violence towards the end are dubious occurrences. Yet that and a couple of fart gags not withstanding, this is an innocuous affair that epitomises family entertainment. 7/10."
"The Best Animation!!!","17 November 2015","4/10","The Lion King is one of Disney film that I've watched many times. I really enjoyed it, since I was in grade 3. It is a great film, also very well-made. This is the film that can be entertaining in any ages. It was funny, emotional, and had family drama. And the songs are all nice and meaningful. The whole story had explained that what life is, how to be strong throughout the problems in life and the way to getting peace.The King Mufasa has told his son to be brave when he had to be. I really liked the sentence, and that's what my dad had always told me.Simba tried his best to be strong after his father had killed by Scar and Scar had forced him to run out of the Pride Land. Under control of Scar, the Pride Land has no food, no water.After Simba became an adult, he comes back to fight with Scar to get the Pride Land back. Then, the Pride Land becomes as before and peacefully.The Lion King is the best movie ever for every ages <3 <3"
"for the next day","28 December 2021","10/10","""The Lion King"". And, there are so many similarities that I cannot rate this wonderful film any higher than an 8--as it lacks originality. Sure, I loved Ed and felt my heart tugged by the film and loved the music--but it was a ripoff, ur.... I mean 'very similar'. Not a bad film at."
"One of the best animated films of all time","20 April 2020","10/10","The Lion King was pretty much my favourite movie growing up. It was one of those movies I probably watched dozens of times between the age of 2 and 6, so much so I probably had the entire film committed to memory at some point. So I definitely had fond memories of it, and still felt a great deal of emotional attachment towards the film, but for a while I started thinking- is the movie actually any good? Or was it just overwhelming nostalgia telling me that the movie was better than it really is in cold, cynical, objective reality?I went and watched the film when it was re-released in cinemas back in 2011- in 3D, of course, which was resoundingly ""meh,"" but the whole gimmicky 3D stuff didn't even matter. I was getting to see one of my most fondly remembered childhood films on the big screen, and it was kinda exciting. Of course, the excitement could have led me to be massively let down when viewing the film as an older and (slightly) more mature individual, but thankfully, to my relief, the movie was awesome. I enjoyed it just as much at 17 as I had enjoyed it at 4, and came to realise that the movie was indeed a great one. Nostalgia may have helped a bit, but I still think from a more objective standpoint this is a damn great film- almost certainly my favourite animated movie of all time.Of course it's hard to pick a favourite animation film in a universe where Pixar exists. My pick for my favourite animation film could easily go to almost any of Pixar's masterpieces, but I guess I just feel a bit more connected to The Lion King. There's definitely something very special about it, but it's all a bit tough to put into words.I guess all I can really say is that it's a movie that's just fundamentally effective. Does that make sense? I don't know. There's just so many good components of this movie, and they all come together so well to deliver an extremely satisfying experience.For starters, the story is a fantastic one, dealing with themes of fate, death, pride, betrayal, and other things you don't usually see in a kid's film. The film can get pretty dark at times, but thankfully never to an overwhelming extent, because this does have to be child accessible after all. And I'm also thankful for the fact this movie's not all doom and gloom because it allows for some great humour. I still think Timon and Pumba are a hilarious duo- if you told me you thought they were annoying as hell, I wouldn't argue, but for some reason they never got on my nerves and I found them hysterical. Oh, and Rowan Atkinson as the frequently abused bird servant Zazu is fantastic.That's another thing worth mentioning- the voice acting. It's great across the board, and serious props has to go to whoever helped cast this movie, as there were some incredibly great choices here. Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones... even Matthew Broderick is perfectly suited to his character.The animation and the overall look of the film is brilliant too. There's so much colour in this movie, and it really didn't need a gimmicky 3D conversion for one to become completely immersed in the film's world.And yeah, the music needs a mention too. I know everybody loves all the really memorable songs from the movie, and I imagine I'm not the only person who will never forget the particularly catchy ones (I'm looking at you 'I just can't wait to be king'), but I think more credit needs to go to Hans Zimmer's brilliant score. Zimmer is maybe one of the most praised composers still working today, and while I often find his music works very well with the movies he writes it for, the pieces of music themselves are usually kind of underwhelming to listen to by themselves. However, his score for The Lion King I think is absolutely brilliant, and I also believe his instrumental stuff is just as good as the undeniably catchy and more well-known Elton John songs.So, just watch this movie. You don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. Who says animated films are only for kids anyways?"
"Childhood","21 September 2018","10/10","I have watched this over and over as a kid and I just love the concept of the story even when it was involved educationally through the education system."
"A Film that Animated Film Makers today should take notes from.","30 April 2018","10/10","Lion King is not only an animation masterpiece but a film masterpiece overall. The technique of cinematography and visual story telling used in Lion King is some of the best seen in Film. Each scene provides a purpose to strike an emotion within you. Complimented by the outstanding soundtrack, the story can be easily told without a word being said, although the characters voice actors and dialogue is just as good. The animation is fluid and beautiful and feels life like in every frame. Lion King is easily some of Disney's best two-dimensional animation work.The cast is charming, memorable, and their personalities never feels forced or unnecessary. Their voice actors all feel appropriate and their voices distinguish them perfectly, making them feel alive with personality. Each of the characters have their place and don't get in the way of one another with their importance to the plot. At the same time, the characters are never just there for the party. They all contribute to the overall plot and they're all likable in their own rights.Simba, the main character, is the perfect token example of character growth and development throughout The Lion King. Simba starts a curious child and as he grows and discovers more about who he is, he becomes the hero of the story. Nala, while the romance is not the main focus of the story, is the perfect contrast to Simba to allow him to grow and mature after his father is gone. Her character allows Simba's growth to shine and develop the pivitol theme of the story.Scar is an amazing villain, to say the least. He sadistic, yet charming personality, and foul selfish character, makes him an excellent memorable villain.Comedic Relief in the Lion King is perfectly done. The characters, Timon and Pumbaa, being the film's more lighthearted and comedic personalities are done with subtlety. Many times a comedic relief character can feel forced and irritating but Lion King approached these two and added more emotional depth to them. Their reactions and dialogue is appropriate to the scenario and they're much better characters for it.While I do enjoy Lion King the most of all animated films, nothing is absolutely perfect and neither is The Lion King. Luckily, most of the cons with The Lion King are mostly nit picks.The effects that the villain, Scar, had on Pride Rock were not shown until the end of the film. There was much build up to Scar taking over pride rock but after he had taken over he was not shown in the film for quite some time.The third hyena character of the hyena trio, Ed, is nothing more than a stereotypical funny idiot character. He's only supposed to be ""funny"" because he is an idiot. This is a one-dimensional, and forgettable character.Simba's mother, Sarabi, had very few screen time. This is a flaw in my opinion, as she was the last thread of leadership for the Pride Rock lions under scar's rule aside from Nala. It would've added more to her character and would have made her more memorable of a character. Aside from these few nitpicks, The Lion King is absolute masterpiece and should be regarded as such. The Lion King is a film, modern animated film makers should be taking notes from."
"Greatest Movie ever made!","22 April 2015","10/10","The Lion King is not only my favorite Disney movie, it's my favorite movie PERIOD. The film was a major box office success and won several academy awards, including ""Best Original Song"". And for darn good reason. I have loved The Lion King from the moment I first watched it as a kid. The good stuff in this film is really good. Oh, man, where do I begin? First of all, the story. I like how this movie isn't based on a book or fairy tale. I also love how this film manages to accomplish a pretty solid story when there are no people in this movie, just animals. Now that I mentioned that, I should say that the characters are memorable. Simba is fun to watch, particularly as a kid. Mufasa is also a very like able character. The hyenas are funny and Timon and Pumbaa make great comic relief. Scar was also a very well-done villain. The voice-acting here is terrific. All the actors play who they are supposed to be perfectly. I also loved the animation in this movie. This is the best-looking hand-drawn animated film. It looks best in scenes like the opening scene, the stampede, and the battle between Simba and Scar. I also LOVED the songs. Every one is great to listen to, and my favorite is ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"". I don't know what more to say. I adore it. I've seen it a million times and plan on watching it a million times more."
"Tremendously Moving Film.","4 August 2009","9/10","The Lion King is one of the best animated films that I have seen along with Aladdin. It is highly moving and one of the most emotional films that I have ever seen.Simba is a young lion who is the heir apparent as King of the pridelands to his father Mufasa. However his evil Uncle Scar wants to be king. When tragedy hits Simba, he leaves the pridelands despite the fact that it is his destiny to be the next king.As far as animation goes, this is legendary. All of the animals look like they do in real life. The scenery is amazing.The songs are good also, not nearly to the level of Aladdins songs, but pretty good. However the non singing music in the background is outstanding.As far as villains go, I think Scar has to be one of the most evil. He is an evil lion who alligns with HYENAS!!!! In case you are not well informed as far as animals go, Hyenas and Lions are bitter enemies who hate each other. The idea of a lion turning his back on lion kind and alligning with hyenas is unthinkable. One of the most evil villains who does help make a great conflict.All of the characters are great. Especially Mufasa, voiced by legendary James Earl Jones. The lessons that he tries to teach his son are phenomenal and ones that envoke a lot of emotion. This film has a lot of moments that are tremondously moving and make me want to cry at parts. Also it has the saddest moment in movie history in my opinion, I wont give it away though.As far as voice acting goes, this film has the best cast to my knowledge. Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Johnathon Taylor Thomas, and many other great voices.Easily one of the best films that I have ever seen. Highly recommended."
"Has the Disney magic","5 September 2002","7/10","The Lion King was the best Disney film of 1994, and perhaps for a few years after. We all know Disney's been hashing up cheap tricks for kids-dumb sequels like Lady and the Tramp 2, Cinderella 2, all that stuff recently. But the Lion King was great, and the all star cast including: Rowan Atkinson, Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones really help this film too! Great animation, story, and characters. The Lion King's a great film!3.5/5 STARS-JOHN ULMER"
"Awesome Film","31 October 2016","9/10","Awesome Film I love the story and idea concept. It is a family oriented movie with laughs, morals, and values. It was a lesson learned from a youth and took that and made it a positive at the end of the day. The film Simba was a young lioness who was very Innocent and naive as a youngster. Only to be manipulated by his so called uncle that ended up persuading him that he was the reason his dad got killed. But to only realized as he become older that all of it was a lie. He found out that his uncle was the one to have set him up. So in revenge, he goes back as an adult lion to fight for his pride and territory. By doing this, he was able to continue the legacy his father have paved for him."
"kings never die","29 December 2019","7/10","A big part of my childhood
and I'm so glad to see this animation at the right time"
"Hamlet with more Cats","23 August 2012","1/10","This was my favourite movie for the longest time. The music, the animation, the voice actors, they all did a great job. But looking at it again there are somethings that don't work, such as why did Scar reign cause a drought? But anyway I still found many things that I still enjoyed. The comedy for me works very well, I laugh so hard whenever I see this movie. The songs, although all very catching, listening to them again I found some were annoying and were just alright. But I found that the orchestral score greatly outshines the singing ones. The voice actors, especially James Earl Jones, do a great job and I see them fit into their roles perfectly. The movie also gets some of its story from one of Shakespeare's greatest works, Hamlet. And finally, the animation is spectacular. Every bit looks grand and big. The style looks great. The scenes go from colourful and cheery to dark and violent. The climax, almost similar in power to Bambi, is one of the best in Disney's history, mixing powerful emotions and visuals. All in all, I must say it's still one of my favourite of Disney movies."
"to be, or not to be, that is the question?","29 February 2012","10/10","When i watched The Lion King for the first time, it was about 15 years ago. I was very young, and the death of Mufasa made me cry. And this year, I went to the cinema to watch The Lion King 3D. I had thought I would not cry this time, but i was wrong. I cried again in the same scene. It is still an awesome animation. through watching it, i felt this movie is actually based on Hamlet, which is kind of orthodox now. The basic story lines of the two are pretty much similar. Simba and Hamlet went through their fathers' death whose responsibility is on their uncles, and they try to fight against the evil uncles. Dead fathers' shapes make them feel guilty by keeping saying ""remember."" Still, the two works are different at the same time. Simba overcame all the problems and revenged his father. The Lion King ended happily ever after, unlike Hamlet. The differences are from the existence of Timon and Pumbaa, no doubt. The tragic question ""To be, or not to be"" gets replaced with ""Hakuna Matata,"" and the fact makes the wholly different endings. The two amazing and priceless friends are truly huge parts of the movie.This time when i watched it, I felt sorry for Scar a little bit. When i was young, Scar was an absolute villain to me, but i think Scar could be a pathetic thing which desperately desired to be a king. (anyway he definitely did wrong things) maybe I grew too much. Just as Spring comes after Winter, as Simba has his son, i hope the pure days come to me again."
"Rip off of a great older anime","9 May 2000","10/10","This movie is a complete and shameless rip off with no credit given of the original Kimba the white lion made in Japan in the 50's or 60's that I remember seeing as a kid. While the animation is bright and the voice acting is bearable I cannot bear to see Disney continue to take credit for another's work"
"An Instant Classic!","7 November 2008","10/10","The Lion King is the movie that will be honored fro the next thousand years. It's really that good! The movie starts with young Simba being shown to the rest of the world by this old monkey. As the movies goes on, King Mufasa is murdered by his own brother Scar. Scar also banishes Simba from the kingdom. In exile, Simba meets a warthog and a meercat. When Simba becomes an adult, he ventures back home to take on Scar and his hyena sidekicks. Even by today standards, this film has very good animation. Disney always does a good job with animation. The songs and score is excellent and praise-worthy. My favorite songs are ""Circle of Life"" and ""Hakuna Matata."" The voice acting is full of brand-name talent such as James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, and Whoopi Goldberg. I do think that this movie is too violent for a G rating. It should be rated PG. Overall, an excellent family classic! I rate this movie 10/10."
"brilliant Disney animated film","9 May 2009","10/10","this Disney film was probably the most ambitious undertaking by the studio up to that time.the amount of animated sequences are astounding and the detail equally so.so from a technical stand point it's brilliant.and the content of the movie is great as well.the story is wonderful.and unlike many earlier Disney animated movies movies,the villain in this movie is much less evil,and the movie is suitable for most ages.there are a few intense scenes though,and a scene dealing with ***possible minor spoiler***the loss(death)of a character.other than that,though,it should OK for anyone.there are also a fair amount of catchy songs that kids will like,and even the adults might like.for me,The Lion King is a 10/10"

"Awesome","9 February 2007","10/10","I first watched this movie when I was about 3. lol, back then I didn't appreciate it, but I now have the video downstairs in my collection. The Lion King has many wonderful, comprehensible morals which are built up right to the very end. Plenty of action, a well designed plot, great animations, (I personally like the songs). It is a very well thought out film, and although it may appear to be for younger audiences, I would still encourage everyone to see it at least twice. This video is basically a biography of a young lion born to a ""royal"" family (the lion being the ""king of beasts"") Symba lives the life that many of us can relate to, curioius when young, and he grows up to be a great and mighty king due to his experiences along the way. Faced, however, by an ""evil uncle"", he must face many hardships along the way, including separation from his family for a long time. All these years of pain, and renewed love of the friendship that he bonds with an unlikely couple of Timone an pumba, This film really touches the viewer on an emotional level.A superb production."
"A masterpiece","28 October 2019","7/10","U can't get your eyes of the screen.. Hugely entertaining"
"A great movie","11 February 2007","10/10","It was a great story that I loved as a little kid and still love and watch the movie.It was a lovely animated movie that was a laugh to watch and really gets to my heart.The music was great the chose the best artists for the movie and really brought the story out.Elton john was a great beginning artist to open the movie.This movie deserves a perfect ten out of ten and deserves to to go down as one of the best animated movies of all times and Disney show open this up as one great family film that should stay out for all future generations to watch and enjoy forever.I wish to see this movie even when i am older and watch it with my children and use it to remember my childhood and remember it for as long as i live."
"Disney Classic","1 January 2018","6/10","Undoubtedly a classic family movie that has meaning and enjoyment in store for all ages."
"Its a Disney classic.","17 April 2018","NA","This movie is pretty good. Except for a few dumb moments and ideas, this movie is very entertaining with great animation, story, and voice acting. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I'd recommend watching it."
"The past can hurt... But the way I see it - you can either learn from it or run from it","30 April 2018","NA","The animated movie of a childhood with simple yet philosophical texts. Simba has to decide his and his pride's fate. Young king has to discover himself and take place in ""a circle of life""."
"good","19 September 2023","NA","The Lion King, a beloved classic in the world of animation, is a film with remarkable strengths and a few notable weaknesses. Its strength lies in the timeless music and visually stunning African landscapes that captivate viewers. The voice acting, led by James Earl Jones as Mufasa, is undeniably powerful and emotionally resonant. However, despite its memorable moments, the film occasionally suffers from pacing issues and lacks the depth of character development found in some of Disney's other classics. While it may not quite reach the pinnacle of perfection, The Lion King earns its 6/10 rating as an enjoyable and visually captivating journey into the Circle of Life, cherished by audiences for generations."
