"Wow this American loves this movie","20 November 2011","9","I asked my co-workers to recommend a Bollywood movie. I expected ""Dumb and Dumber"" by the title. It wasn't that at all. It is more of an inspirational comedy with some serious but good messages. A more accurate title would have been ""The Legend of Rancho"".Odd to me is that they speak in part English, part Hindi through the movie, kinda like some speak ""Spanglish"" here I suppose. I know none of the actors but the acting was good, and there was plenty of humor. The characters were believable. Most movie dancing I find a little silly but I even liked the dancing routines in the bathroom.I will be asking my co-workers for more recommendations after this one!"
"Hat-Trick Heroes x 3...","2 October 2020","9","Like Dead Poets Society but with Robin Williams as a student and some extra tonic and spice thrown in for good measure. Serious, sad and silly, often concurrently but overwhelmingly very, very funny and engaging, as engineering students at an Indian college end up teaching as much as they learn. Who could disagree with the distinction between education and learning while recognising the often sizable gulf that exists between the two after watching this. Who would dissuade those with aspiration and passion from pursuing their dreams and goals. Weighing in not too shy of three hours you'll be shocked how quickly the time flies as your attention is vacuumed up and your view of the world turned on its head, or inverted, depending what you've learned."
"Don't be fooled by its name, it's a great movie","3 August 2021",NA,"The film not only shows the mistakes of the education system, but also reveals how the truth should be. That life is not actually a race; reveals that this is imposed on us by the education system. Rancho, our character who opposes the order at every opportunity, cannot make sense of not talking about new ideas but grades at schools. Because he goes to school to learn, not for a diploma, he gives importance to knowing the meaning, not memorizing, he does not say ""what I learn at school stays at school"", he applies what he learns in daily life. The secret of its success; Reading the part he is passionate about."
"THE BEST OF BOLLYWOOD; please sing along....","15 June 2021","9","When I was 13, I had my first movie-love;
There was nothing that compared to this movie;
Nobody could eva stop me watchn this cult;
It had me goin crazy, oh I was star-struck!Watched every weekend, didn't need no other work;
Made me laugh made me cry made me become what I am today;
Inspired me, motivated me to achieve success every day;I was choking in the crowd, it made me roar aloud;
I was nowhere in my career, it made me a flourisher;
I used to be havin a bad time, it took me to cloud nine;
I was in pieces, it fixed me;
It made me a it made me a believer, believer.I was in pieces, it fixed me.It gave me another chance, I grew up once again
Na na na.... Na na na.... Na na na.... Na na nana na...."
"Wonderfully entertaining.","2 June 2011","9","It's hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.Like so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since ""3 Idiots"" is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.As for the plot, it's very long and involved and I could recount what occurs. But I don't want to spoil a single wonderful moment, so my advice is just sit back and watch--and if you give it a chance, I can almost guarantee you'll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. Wonderful and well worth your time--with a delightful script, wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears. See this film."
"^_^The best film reflecting Asia's education ever!","19 February 2011",NA,"As many ordinary Chinese high school students,who have to study fourteen(14) hours every day for the college entrance examination in the final year,I was entirely shaken and moved by ""3 idiots"",sharing the same feeling with all the students from high schools and universities in China(or Asia). O(∩_∩)O Compared with mainland China,India is lucky,having less corruption in education system.This film is incredible inspiring,especially for those who are struggling or ""survived"" in high schools and colleges.I read some reviewer,some doubt whether suicide in the film is logical,which is really DISAPPOINTING! (—__—!)If you experience the life in poverty areas in Asia,you will understand what a significant role the higher educations play in their lives. Burdening great pressure from family and society,they attach great expectation and significance to the enrollment of colleges,and they intend to abandon poverty by getting higher education.Diploma means everything for them. Thus,the plot where the man committed suicide after lost the chance to graduate is reasonable."
"Finally a masterpiece from Bollywood. Aamir Khan is the best thing to happen to Bollywood.","9 September 2013","9","Awesome film man. Saw this with my family in a theatre. Worth every penny n worth every minute. Never seen such an amazing film from Bollywood.
What is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. The last 30 mins were beautifully shot. Very good direction by Hirani. The star cast is good n Aamir khan steals the show.
The editing is top notch. U don't feel bore for even a sec. Awesome screenplay. It's hands down the best film in the history of Bollywood."
"Missed this gem for 12 years - Thanks to my wife","2 May 2021","9","Thought provoking movie, it shows how Indian Parents force their children's.

"Aal izz very, very, very, very, very Well","24 December 2009",NA,"""Whatever the problem in life is... just say to yourself 'Aal Izz Well'.. This wont solve your problems but it will give the courage to face it.."" ""Chase Excellence and success will follow"".. "" Life is not about getting marks, grades but chasing your dreams"".. These are the golden rules which 3 IDIOTS teaches you in a very light and entertaining way.. The movie makes you laugh and in the process you learn many golden rules which can alter your life in a big manner...3 actors from the path-breaking blockbuster RANG DE BASANTI( Aamir, Sharman, Madhvan) team up together with Rajkumar Hirani.. It couldn't get bigger! Loosely based on blockbuster novel ' Five Point Someone ' by Chetan Bhagat the movie deals with the present education system in India that whether getting more marks and better grades is better than gaining knowledge and is mugging up everything more useful than understanding it..The movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Boman Irani to Omi Vaidya were superb in their roles.. Aamir has outdone himself.. Never in the film he has looked 44 year old... Film's music sounds mediocre but when viewed on the screen then the music sounds perfect.. Cinematography is awesome and so is the direction.. Raju Hirani's screenplay(you can easily ignore a few loose points) is a masterpiece and the film will achieve cult status for engineering students in a short period of time.. It has the soul which Five Point Someone had.. It is easily Aamir Khan's finest film to date.. The film's climax is fantabulous and is a shocker.. It takes everyone by surprise...To conclude 3 IDIOTS has the potential to break all records and sweep all awards.. Watch it... You will Love it...My Rating: 9/10Thanks and Regards"
"easily the best Indian movie in 2009.... and one of the best ever","24 December 2009","10","I was lucky to see the first day show of 3 idiots on Thursday in Dubai. Well the title of this post says it all. The movie is an example of classic film making. brilliant and highly entertaining.Watch 3 idiots for a) amir khan's incredible acting b) intelligent and highly energatic screenplay & direction (Rajkumar Hirani has done it yet again!) c) amazing chemistry among actors, d) some of the best comedy scenes coming from Indian cinema in a long time and e) a heart warming story which keeps you spell binded right till the end.I would rate it as among the best from amir khan (which obviously means among the very best from bollywood. I would also give a lot of credit to the director rajkumar hirani, who after this movie (and his previous munna bhai series) should rank as among the top in bollywood too. 9/10."
"One of the better Bollywood movies I saw","6 February 2016","10","Because the movie had such a high rating on IMDb I was intrigued. Bollywood movies are not particularly on the top of my list I must admit. But I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. It only has two scenes where they start singing and dancing so that was not too much. Why they start singing and dancing that I will never get. The story does not need that at all. The story itself was very pleasant to follow. Full of mixed emotions, happy ones and sad ones. The cast and the filming was great. All actors gave a good performance throughout the whole movie. Like in most American television series they want to give you a lesson in life and most of the time it makes me want to barf but in this Bollywood movie it works perfectly well. I had fun watching this and I get why I am not the only one. Certainly worth a watch."
"Scarcely has a comedy provided its audience with so much insight, intelligence, and human affection","3 January 2013",NA,"""All is well,"" the three ""idiot"" heroes of 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief.But all is well, as they so often say. Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots, my introduction to the world of Bollywood cinema, is a comedy-drama unlike any one I've ever seen, long, but never drawn out, frantic, but never desperate, and emotional, but never manipulating. It provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade, and with insight to the culture of Indians and their parents. Rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind, while possessing a title not even fit for a farce.Our title characters are ambitious but stunted Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), jittery, fearful Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and borderline prodigy Ranchhoddas ""Rancho"" Shamaldas Chhanchad (Aamir Khan), three close friends who attend the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE), one of India's most prestigious colleges where only the best are accepted. The young boys already are facing some of life's greatest challenges, all of them pursuing the field of engineering when the only one who seems to have a passion for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father, and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty, with his father's expensive health bills, his mother's fragile core, and his sister's inability to marry all on the table. Rancho is studying because he feels that one should pursue passion and make a career out of it, so it doesn't feel like work. If you're passionate and devoted to your work, success will find you - yet this is only one of the countless morals and insights 3 Idiots provide its viewer with.The film chronicles their issues in college in flashback, with instances in the presence popping up to show Farhan and Raju searching for their pal Rancho, who has disappeared and avoided contact for several years now. This is not your typical flashback film, however. It uses this method much to its advantage, and doesn't feel like a narrative within a narrative. It seals both stories nicely, but it takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions through carefully constructed events before it even arrives at those endings.One of their problems in college is the professor/dean of the campus, Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), who the three derogatorily call ""Virus"" when his back is turned. Virus is strict and often largely unsympathetic to the problems of his students, which allows the film to explore a dark topic one assumes a comedy wouldn't dare cross paths with and that is the issue of Indian teen suicide. One kid had his father have a stroke, rendering him unable to focus on academics for months, falling gravely behind. Virus is grossly unsympathetic to his case, denying him an extension on a project he's work so unrealistically hard on but can not perfect.If anything, we can say 3 Idiots is a message to the parents of the Indian youth and that is to stop applying pressure to an already stressed out demographic. I've read several articles articulating the point that Indian teenagers are among one of the highest in suicide rates, and that many parents put an unrealistic amount of pressure, duty, and responsibility on the child to the point of a physical and mental collapse. You're given the unalienable freedom to raise your kids with the method you choose, but not every method is perfect, and when your method is one of the ones that leads to suicide, mental health problems, and perpetuates fear and anxiety in the minds of teenagers, then you may want to reevaluate your methods.3 Idiots also provides us with the idea that many Indian children are told what to become in life early and are discouraged from exploration or even personal ambition. This I can't believe. What an unhappy, uninspiring, completely wasted life to slog through everyday doing something you loathe all because it was the lucky career choice of your parents. Yet I'm sure millions have been lead through this same life. It's the worst way of ""living through a person"" that I can imagine.The film runs ten minutes shy of three hours, which for few viewers may seem too long and uncomfortable. I was skeptical myself walking in rather blind. Almost every Bollywood film I've conducted research on seems to run an upwards of three hours, some extending and testing the waters to roughly five hours. If other Bollywood works have characters drawn along the same lines of being relatable, human, and easily accessible and not biased towards race or social class, I can't see it being a struggle to get through any of the industry's films.Through every quick-witted song and dance number, through every comedic scene, through every instance of dramatic despair, emotionally alive moment, solemnly poignant sequence, suspenseful setup, to a lovely, heartfelt conclusion, 3 Idiots is a wonderful, invaluable endeavor in the world of film. Its actors are beautifully fitting for their roles, assisted by a script so human and true to life that it is honestly hard to believe, and captured through beautifully alive cinematography to collectively give us a beautiful package not just in the figurative sense. This is arguably one of the best comedies I've ever seen."
"Good, but they overdid it.","28 December 2009","10","I was eager to watch this movie as the only bollywood films i like are those of aamir khan. When i saw the trailer of the movie, i thought that this movie could be the best of all time in bollywood, but it considerably failed to be. The plot was somewhat interesting , the cast was very appropriate, the acting was superb, the dialogues were wonderful , but the director maybe oozing with overconfidence, tried to put just too much in it. He tried to put it in ALL the good and bad things a teenager should do while he is in college. It was hard to identify the real protagonist in this movie, and even in the end i was left wondering whether raju was the man in the spotlight or aamir. What i hate to watch and hear is a meaningless song with meaningless lyrics and meaningless dance. And thats just what was very prominent in the movie. I don't understand the purpose of such futile non-sense, is it because people like it ? OH REALLY??? or is it because the director finds it attractive? attractive like - cow dung over cake.!? Another flaw i noticed was the change in character of aamir - from when he was a small kid to his teenage years. He looked and behaved like the most innocent one and out-of-all-activities one and later he became the most notorious and daring guy in college. Let the movie be pathetic or super-hit , boman irani was as always at his peak. His character was very well presented and he did just fine enough to make him the funniest as well as the most brutal character in the movie. The movie also had a lot of dramatic, sensitive scenes, at the wrong times, which did at times bring tears in my eyes, and left the other brain-left-at-home audience sob while staring at the screen. I wont say anything about Kareena because there isn't any need to publicize her flaws, there's a need to look for the minimal positivity in her enacting of her cameo. Rest was very appeasing , it was a pleasure to watch nonetheless, and the film was worth watching. 7/10"
"3 hours of stereotypes, melodrama and rehashed jokes from the nineties","29 December 2009","10","I got to see this movie at a special screening before it hit the theaters. The high expectation was palpable. After all, Aamir Khan has been producing successive hits over the years. Now for the movie - which starts in an engineering college in India, goes on to show the lives of three of its students through the years till they graduate. This being a Bollywood film, obviously has a smattering of romance and song and dance sequences. Right from the start where Aamir jaywalks into the college building without a care in the world to the time he starts questioning the teaching methods in class, its just a matter of a couple of days. Some cheeky guy this is! Unfortunately, all his antics and funny lines are as old as the college building he is in. You would have heard these jokes a hundred times over. Anyways, that is the best part of the film since it at least elicits a few laughs. The rest of the 3 hours is filled with stereotypes and melodramatic scenes which are ridiculous at best. It seems that these days in India, anyone who can make the audience cry can laugh all the way to the bank. Aamir has this knowledge and isn't afraid to use it."
"Very good movie!","6 February 2012",NA,"This is the very first time i write a review, mostly because I'm very lazy.However I just watched this film and i gotta admit it...I loved it!!!!At first i was like well ""lets see what this movie has to offer""(btw its also the first Indian movie I've ever seen) and I was like okayits funny and then... like wow so thoughtful and reflexive! It reallymade me meditate about my career and my real dreams! Its a very goodmovie! I'll recommend it to all my friends!You must watch it!All is Well!"
"more than just a laugh...taught me great life lessons as well","1 March 2011","10","I'm from the Philippines. For years, I have always been curious about Indian cinema. I've seen clips of Indian films on cable TV and to be honest...I just don't get it. I don't get all the silly dancing and singing in almost all movies. I find it so corny and irrelevant to the story. But don't get me wrong, Philippine movies back in the 80's were also filled with corny singing and dancing. But we have gone past those and transitioned into movie-making based on good scripts...rather than cheesy story lines. When a friend of mine recommended this movie, I haven't really heard of it. I thought it was a Hollywood release but it wasn't. It was a Bollywood movie. He said it was really funny, so out of curiosity, I got hold of a copy. My first thought was that it was nothing but a silly story of 3 guys doing slapstick comedy that I have all seen before. When they started singing ""All iz well.."" I told myself... I knew it! Just what I thought.But as the movie progressed...I was amazed at the intelligence embedded in this movie. I was so impressed with the smart dialogues delivered by Amir Khan. It was so mature and thought-provoking. The life crisis all of them were in... the pressures at school..the pressures from society and the pressures from family as well... they rang so true. I was even at one time crying my heart out. I can't believe it! All the preconceived notions about a Bollywood movie were obliterated. I was so moved by this picture and I have no regrets seeing it."
"Best moive","14 April 2021","10","Best of all. The way of narrating the story touches the soul in the heart because the college life which we go through it have shown so many rules when it will start imagining in your own real life that is really true in every life we have certain role and we have to go through it."
"If this had come from Hollywood and not Bollywood it might have cleaned up at the Oscars.","26 September 2020",NA,"The title may conjur up images of the 3 Stooges and the crude humour of the opening might suggest a Hindi ""Porky's"" but with a running time of almost three hours ""3 Idiots"" clearly has its mind on higher things. It's a Bollywood buddy-movie devised as an epic and determined to outdo all the competition and being a Bollywood movie is full of large-scale musical numbers as well as a lot of very broad and very funny comedy.The 3 idiots of the title meet as engineering students, become life-long friends but are separated by that old fickle finger of fate. It's also bold enough to deal with such issues as suicide and poverty and, of course, the caste system and is lifted onto an altogether higher plain by a terrific performance from Aamir Khan as 'the idiot' the other two worship and who, naturally, isn't an idiot at all but the sharpest tool in the box and he's brilliantly supported by Sharman Joshi as his potentially suicidal friend and Omi Vaidya as his number one rival. Brilliantly directed by Rajkumar Hirani this is the kind of film Hollywood could learn a lot from and which, had it been a Hollywood film, might well have swept the boards come Oscar time."
"This Christmas & New Year, go gift yourselves - watch this phenomena (Not for Professors) !","25 December 2009","10","I'm an IITian myself and hence, needless to say, was looking forward to this movie as it is based on the life in IITs. I went with my family and watched the first-day-first-show and was I pleased ? In one sentence - The best Bollywood movie ever ! If you are into movies, then this one is not to be missed unless you are the 4th idiot. I cried, I laughed and I enjoyed every moment of the 3 hours that I spent watching this gem. The songs that seemed mediocre before watching the movie, feel like perfect for the movie. They are so ideal for the situations that I just loved them.As you can understand, they could not bring the name of any IIT into the movie to avoid disputes. But trust me, whatever they have shown about the life in IITs, it's all true. Right from suicides, cold-hearted Professors to lack of encouragement and support for talents who can really bring serious change in this world. The movie successfully depicts how once inside, your life is only about meaningless grades, go get into the race before it's too late.Take my free advice and avoid any reviews or words from people who have already seen the movie. Don't let anyone spoil any scene from the movie. Rush to the nearest theater and experience the phenomenon for yourself. You'll bless me for this advice !"
"Aamir has yet again chased excellence & success follows him !","24 December 2009","10","Plot Two idiots Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman) sets outs on a journey to find their lost friend and the 3rd idiot Rancho (Aamir).. As the journey starts off, their college life and old memories of their friendship, with a unique free-thinker Rancho who inspired them and changed their lives, are unfolded through flashbacks and followed with some twists and turns...My Views 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurizes the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it... On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to ""Five Point Someone"", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...Both humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...Technically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...Coming to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...On the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer's liberty and the episode of Mona's delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that ""chase excellence and success will follow"".. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...So to sum up, Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...Verdict : THE BEST of 2009 !

"Had Potential but Lacked Execution","16 June 2020",NA,"Unlike many other Bollywood movies, 3 Idiots was enjoyable - at some points.Firstly, the film provides a useful message - do what you love rather than what someone else thinks you should do. It also has a clever and quite unpredictable plot which makes the film certainly watchable.However, the reason for this film's downfall is due to its comedic aspect. The jokes and comedy to this film is super immature and childish and wouldn't make 99% of adults laugh. I genuinely believe that if this film had little to no comedic aspects, or at least a less childish comedic aspect, and was a serious film it could be comparable to Good Will Hunting.Had the potential to be a global success but only succeeded domestically."
"This inspires me to watch more Bollywood movies","20 September 2017","10","Until recently my only exposure to Indian cinema was Satyajit Ray. Like a lot of Americans, my knowledge of Bollywood was based entirely on film clips and American take-offs of lavish musical numbers.I searched a few lists of top Bollywood films and settled on 3 Idiots, which turned out to be a wonderful decision. The movie is terrifically funny and engaging, seamlessly moving from comedy to tragedy to musical numbers.The story centers around a brilliant, iconoclastic technical student who spends the movie telling people to follow their dreams. While generally lighthearted, the movie strongly addresses the apparently terrible stresses on Indian college students. But in spite of some dark moments, overall this is about as feel-good as you can get. Feel-good to an absurd degree? Sure. But what's so bad about feeling good?When I think of Bollywood I think of big musical numbers, and there are a handful here, although they're a tiny part of the three-hour running time. Still, they are tremendous fun.To sum up, I saw a Bollywood movie, I laughed, I cried, and now I want to see more.UPDATE: I saw more. So many good movies out there!"
"Great Entertainer / but Story and Character holes","17 February 2010","10","3 Idiots is way too short a movie, which is simply another way of saying that it is an extremely entertaining movie! Raju Hirani has served an hat trick. Three great movies in a row. Raju has brought his Gandhigiri to the world of education, this time the Gandhian is Rancho.Acting is great by Boman Irani, Sharman Joshi and the best Omi Vaidya or Chatur, without whom 3 idiots would not have been what it is.Its almost impossible to find any significant deviations to excellence when you have a team like this one. Raju, Boman, Aamir, the perfectionist to name a few.But there were a couple of things under the surface that disturbed me a little bit.To start with the easy one, When you anger your senior in the first 5 minutes of entering the college, you know for sure it cannot end there. So from that point of view, the ragging scene mysteriously ends prematurely. Another one is, Boman Iirani or Virus knows Rancho's dad's monthly income but not his address? They spend 10 years searching for him, why didn't they check the college register?Now for some serious ones.I like Aamir Khan movies because you never ever ever see Aamir, you only see the character he is playing, which is exactly how it should be. Unlike Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan movies where you see the movie stars instead of their characters (exceptions apply of course, for example in ""Chak de India"" you couldn't find Shah Rukh even if you wanted to). In 3 idiots, I got to see Aamir Khan more than a couple of times and I was surprised. That got me thinking, why would our perfectionist entertainer allow for something like this.The plot thickens and the mystery deepens. Hmmmm. So I dug deeper and eventually hit the gold mine. Its not Aamir, it's his character Rancho which has a fundamental flaw that even Aamir could not overcome. Rancho is projected as someone who loves to learn, he wants to take in every ounce of knowledge he can absorb for any source possible. But his actions are that of a revolutionary, from teaching the director on how to teach to mocking the definitions of machines and books. On one side he is a sponge, an introvert on the other hand he is a rebel, and extrovert. These opposites needed reconciliation in the story.Somewhere along the way, even meanness crept in. I am referring to Chatur's switched speech. Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed every bit of that scene. But that does not mean that it flowed with Rancho's character. I think the writers mixed up Aamir's earlier characters, Aakash from Dil Chahta Hai would do this in a heartbeat, DJ from ""Rang de Basanti"" would probably go one step beyond, but not Rancho and definitely not for a ""demo"". Rancho is pure, or at least that's what Raju is portraying him. The same goes with the climax. Now, even though, all of us cheered when Chatur got shafted towards the end in a strange twist of fate. Some how I had a hard time believing that filing 400 patents and signing with the Japanese gel well with this Gandhian educator.Aamir, in his interview, mentioned his approach to looking young in the movie. His pacings, mannerisms, style of dialogue delivery etc. He executes brilliantly on them.Madhavan is decent. He could have been much better.Omi Vaidya, or Chatur, is the real find of this movie. Hope to see more from him.One additional aspect which is not easily apparent is that this is one of the few movies that projects intelligence with the coolness it deserves, and not in the traditional Hollywood style of nerd portrayal. This is a better role model for students. Towards that end it is on par with Matrix.To make it clear, this movie is vastly more entertaining than most of the movies of 2009. But I am not comparing this movie with other movies, that would be like comparing apples with windows. I am comparing this to other Aamir and Raju Herani movies. And in that comparison, this does not shine as bright.______________________Now, here's what I would have changed if I was in control.* Raggers are caught by the director and are convinced without any ""pressure"" not to rag any more * Reconcile Rancho's character's fundamental flaw, requires serious deep dive * Motivation for Chatur's speech prank redone, maybe not even instigated by Rancho * Some better reason why nobody can find Rancho * Redo the Javed Jaffery scene where he talks to his dead father, turning the tables to show that Javed actually wanted to take his father to Disney Land but his father kept on insisting that they wait for the highway contract to go thru. That would be hilarious. * Sharman Joshi's family is so central to him but are missing 10 years later, in the starting scene, some how bring them in. Maybe his wife is on the phone talking to his sister, happily married in Bombay, when she yells ""No Pants"".This review was originally posted on my blog: http://roundhayreview.blogspot.com/2010/01/3-idiots.html"
"idiots...a lot of idiots","22 July 2010",NA,"I am writing this very late, even though I saw the movie on the first dayit took a second fast-forward viewing on my laptop to compel me to opine on this film. And since brushing through the comments, I found a lot of good stuff written about it, I'd like to skip over the brownie points the film certainly deserves and focus on what I found sodisappointing.1) sigh, the jokeswhat to say, I actually felt embarrassed listening to them and hear people guffaw on stuff that evoked chuckles in the 70s. 2) over the top scenes which were just not required- Rancho taking a bath in the garden(!) in front of everyone? In most good institutes even walking on the grass is frowned uponn here this chap doesn't mind spoiling the soil with his soapy water. (This is what annoys me about characters portrayed as non-conformists. They confuse it with plain indecency and ludicrousness, like when Patch Adams bared his bottom after getting his degree); n driving the scooter into the hospital itselfwhy couldn't he just stop at the doorway n make it a genuinely good shot??? 3) The timeline was all wrong; did no one do math at primary school? Farhan says they hadn't seen rancho for 5 yrsramalingam returns after 10 yrs to keep the betno one saw rancho after college finishedengineering is 4 yrsthe bet could not have been made before the second semester as they already have had at least one semester exams!!! Simple math will tell you its all goofed up. Kareena kapoor was engaged when these guys were in 1st-2nd yearso she waited 8 years to get married??? If that banker guy was so considerate and patient, he is the real hero 4) Anybody who has lived in hostel with room mates will tell you that in 4 yrs together, you get to know every minute detail about you buddies; these guys didn't even know rancho's hometown! 5) And these supposedly bright engineers and the doctor Kareena don't have even enough brains to look up the college records to find Rancho's address? They could have at least asked Boman Irani, who would have certainly known it considering he knew Chachad's monthly income! 6) Even with that lame, copied joke 'Do you know who I am', they are just ridiculing their own film; is it so difficult for a professor to find three students of a class whose faces he has seen from the college records? A cheeky antic like that would have meant instant suspension in a real IIT. 7) Hirani's idea of ragging is based on the fairy tales boys brag to wide-eyed fifth-graders; you just cant survive in a hostel if you electrocute a senior's winkie on you first day. I'd have loved it had they shown Rancho getting a beating from seniors in return for his actionsit would have truly highlighted the ragging problem. Instead they showed the whole bunch of seniors running scared on seeing a baby-faced fresher with a live wire. 8) And oh, they took the peeing joke too far, too many timesits disgusting. Ramalingam, a VP of some MNC peeing on a school building? Come on 9) I understand that the ridiculous arrangement barred Rancho from keeping in touch with any student from ICSbut what about Kareena? Was his love so shallow he didn't give a damn about her just to honor some crazy vow which didn't even involve her? How are they showing Indian women? She has no self-respect? She runs away from her wedding, betraying a guy who waited 10 years for her to a guy who left her in a heartbeat? And is it unnatural or materialistic to scream if someone spoils your 2 lac wedding dress or loses a 3 lac watch??? Again the problem with execution of an idea; there were a thousand better ways to expose that guy's shallownessbut all what rancho and his pals did was irritate him by damaging his property. 10) And the law breaking, which when done with timing looks good was just taken too fargetting an international flight stopped, fooling a taxi driver who'd probably lose his job, leaking university paper- they are criminal offenses-why do you need to portray new age thinking with a disdain for the law? 11) And finally even if we forget the fact that any decent college has a medical attendant, a health centre and generators always present to accord a movie a spicy climax, hirani spoilt it with the all-is-well cliché. Cant just one thing be normal?"
"3 idiots is a masterpiece and easily one of the greatest Bollywood movies of all time","24 December 2009","9","I saw the paid premiere of 3 idiots today.On the whole, 3 idiots is a winner all the way everythingwise.3 idiots suits the term 'landmark cinema' and has all it takes to help Bollywood take a giant step into world cinema with pride.3 idiots is a sparkling example of qualitative cinema.3 idiots not only entertains, it also enlightens.3 idiots is forward-thinking, but also makes you recall your roots. It promises lots of laughs and also a heartwarming message.There are movies aplenty, but very few remain etched in your memory and possess recall value. 3 idiots is one of those films. Indisputably and undeniably, this Aamir-Madhavan-Sharman outing is worth the price of the ticket and more.The film will set new records and has the merits to emerge one of the biggest hits of all times. The weekend business should be historic, the Week 1 business should be unparalleled, the lifetime gross should be amongst the biggest of all times. In short, 3 idiots has 'Blockbuster' written all over it.The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. You aren't restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong film-making can enhance and elevate an already solid concept.An Aamir Khan film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up, 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has 'Hit' written all over it. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director Rajkumar Hirani strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives 3 idiots to the winning post."

"One of the best movie of decade","24 December 2009","10","Aamir does it again. what a movie .from start to the end, hilarious moments.screenplay is fantastic. full on comedy and yet it never looses its heart. Aamir pulls off a 22 year old character with brilliance. never for once you feel you are watching aamir .It was rancho on screen. sharman n madhavan - i bow down to them. music looks OK on cd but during movie it worked as a plus point. situational tracks works in the favour of film. runtime may sound a bit too much but believe me, you wont know when the first half is over. second half may seem a bit too hilarious but apart from that its a masterpiece. gr8 aamir ,another brilliant movie.10/10"
"Best Movie of 2009! Aamir Khan reigns Supreme!!","24 December 2009","10","We saw a sneak preview of 3 Idiots last night at Globus Cinema in Bandra, Mumbai.Brilliant. Simply, brilliant.Simple but articulate story telling laced with lots of humour and lessons from life. A wonderful experience to watch as every single actor from Sharman, Madhavan, Boman, Kareena & Aamir deliver probably the best performance in a movie this year.Sharman & Madhavan start off on a journey to seek out their friend Rancho. Together they were the 3 Idiots in college. And they take us the viewers with them on this beautiful journey with such warmth, panache, humour and love, that we don't want the journey to end.Sharman really shows why he's one actor to watch out for. His acting genes come through in every single scene. He's perfect in his role. Sharman, you rock!Madhavan as the guy who's chasing his father's dreams rather than his own is wonderful. The character who learns to laugh at life and it's ironies thanks to his friend Rancho. Madhavan shows his humorous side brilliantly savoring every scene and making it a pleasure to watch. His narration of the movie is very good.Boman Irani is probably the one actor we take most for granted just because he's so brilliant! His characterization of the control-crazy, hyper-active, hyper-competitive, almost dictator-ish, college principal, is beyond words. He plays it so so well, that you love to hate him. He's that Good.Kareena comes through in this movie as one of the finest actresses we have. No one else could have played her part and also looked so beautiful at the same time.And now take it from a hard core Amitabh Bachchan fan, Aamir Khan is the best actor in town today after AB. Period.His range is phenomenal and his characterization of 'Rancho' in this movie is positively brilliant. The small mannerisms, the walk, the smile, the attitude, the brilliance of a young person who's not restricted by the educational system, his positive attitude towards every thing in life, it's Rancho you are looking at. Not Aamir. Aamir's ability to transform himself convincingly from the super-huge well-built temporary amnesia patient on a revenge spree in Ghajini to this whacked out college student, which is half the age he played in last movie shows his prowess as a master actor to transcend age barriers to play almost every role in the book.This is THE best movie of 2009. Aamir again reigns supreme. Thank you Raju Hirani & Vidhu Vinod Chopra.Cliché word, but I have to use it - FANTASTIC !! 10/10 P.S. Don't forget to say 'Aal Izz Well'"
"My most favorite movie.","30 April 2021",NA,"This particular movie is my most favorite movie of all times. I don't even know where to start with. I have definitely watched over 600 movies in my life, and this happens to be the only movie which was able to have a positive impact in my life. Long story short, I have been in the place of each of Rancho, Fahran and Raju in my life. And I have always applied the principles this movie introduced whenever I have been in a tough situation. I have learned to follow after excellence rather than success. I have learned to follow my passion and care less about what society thinks about my decision.Rajkumar Hirani has always addressed a certain issue and/or has boldly hit many lame principles and ethics of the society with a perfect satire. In this movie, it's about the cliched belief that if you're a science student, then it has to be either medical science or engineering if you want to get successful. In the real world, many people have been a victim of this belief and have wasted their life. Had they not been brainwashed by the society, they would've had a better life. That's what the movie justifies and as per my experience, it makes a whole lot of sense. Another thing is, you need to worry about excellence. If you are excellent, the good grades are almost obvious. And in the end it's your excellence that matters, not the grades.Hirani tells the story in his own unique way. Just like in every single one of his movies so far, he crancks up everything to 11 to make sure that his point has reached to the audiences' mind. Many of those cranck ups do not make sense in real life, but that does not even matter because the movie doesn't want that particular cranck up to be relatable. But it does want whatever that cranck up tries to tell to be relatable. And it succeeds in that. And whether or not it makes sense or not, you'll get the point and a great dose of laughter. And there are some of the sequences which are just hilarious and over the top, and are meant just for the sake of laughter. The characters are very likable and quite different from one another. Each of them are a representative of the kind of people there are in the society and in the academic field.The movie doesn't make all kind of sense if you look at it quite literally. Even I would say it's quite nonsensical if I am to look at it literally. But it's meant to be looked at literally. Many scenes are mere representation of something else that the story wants us to know. With that regards, it's pretty good. Even if you watch it at the face value, you won't be bored at all. There will be a build up to something, and the final result will be exactly the opposite of what you expected and that will make you laugh a lot.The songs are pretty good. They aren't the strongest part of the movie by a long shot, but are still popular than many recent Bollywood songs. It's strange that a late 2000s movie had songs which are still popular. Every single actor have given their best performance till date.Rating : absolute 10/10, Grade : golden A+"
"One of the best movies that make you laugh and cry and think at the same time","1 July 2014","10","This is the first Bollywood movie I have seen. (I don't know if ""Slum dog millionaire"" is also an Indian movie or not.) I have learned from my parents long ago that Indian movies are excellent and full of dance scenes. They watched quite a few Indian movies when they were youngsters.Then I had my first experience of watching a Bollywood movie quiet by accident. It was during the sports meet held by the school in which I teach English. I was appointed to do some work using the computer, which we would run some movies when we were free. And the first movie was ""3 Idiots."" I don't know who picked the movie. To be honest, I never would have picked this one myself because of its stupid Chinese title, which, translated back into English, is ""3 idiots who make scenes in Bollywood"". I expected to see a movie that was funny from beginning to end and that could be enjoyed without your brain working too hard. It turned out to be way more than that. It's a movie that made me laugh uncontrollably at some points, shed tears at other points and think all the time.It's about friendship, dream, love and college education. I think the best part is about college education. The situation depicted in the film is almost the same as in China. As a teacher in a high school in China, I know exactly what problems we have in education. What shows in the movie is exactly what happens in China right now. We attach so much importance to grades that teachers and parents will do anything to improve their study, which causes a lot of students' losing interest in study. I recommend all Chinese educators see this movie. I myself have watched it for at least 6 times, including those times I watched it in my class with my students.I give it a ten."
"A wise person may look like an idiot: Chinese proverb","2 September 2011","10","I missed it during the 2010 Hong Kong International Film Festival and am really glad it is released publicly.Haven't seen such a feel good movie for a long time. Excellent and inspiring plot with very positive messages and many hilarious scenes.Inspiring messages and witty lines are dotted throughout the movie, intertwined with some teary scenes: all is well if you follow your passion; chase excellence and success will follow; be brave and follow your dream; think outside the box and be flexible.It challenges our current values on education and success – that we should learn for the sake of learning but not for grades or what others want us to do. What's the point if you memorize everything but do not understand what it means and do not know how to put what you have learned into application? What an inspiring movie. It challenges your comfort thinking mode and urge you to be yourself and chase your dream/passion.Excellent acting, colorful and typical Bollywood musical scenes with uplifting songs and dance moves, not to mention the soothing natural scenery interspersed in the moving episodes of friendship, love, family and playful/stressful campus life.Every student, teacher, and parent or anyone who cares about our future should see it. What kind of world do we want to live in? What kind of person do we want our next generation to be? What kind of lives do we want to lead? This movie makes us ponder on these.Somehow the movie echoed Steve Job's quotes : ""Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people's thinking."" ""Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."" Both Steve and the Rancho character (Aamir Khan) are smart and creative, nice and helpful to friends and people who are willing to learn. They are true to their feelings. They dare to challenge authority and encourages others to do the same. We need more people like these in this world.Just go see it. You won't regret it."
"makes you feel alright","2 November 2011",NA,"I have a 17 year old daughter preparing for college;this morning i told her to watch the movie and even to invite her schoolmates to watch it together.The movie is really entertaining,very well directed,the actors trying to do their best.İt has all the features of Indian cinema,colorful,bright,dancing sequences,songs.I want to believe in rancho's philosophy,though unfortunately i am aware that those thoughts are very naive regarding the real world of jungle.all college students,the ones preparing to be and most importantly,their parents should spare some time for this movie.if all the people in the world behaved like that all would be so fine:)thanks to all the production and casting crew.."
"GOOD in comedy but somewhat below expectation!!!","3 January 2010","10","i recently saw 3idiots in fun cinemas. obviously as the title suggests its a comedy cinema based on intelligent & loving idiots. movie's basic theme as it was promoted as engineering college film follows it before first half , but in the second half it simply becomes an idiotic desi Indian cinema with lot of foolish incidents. this is good to cover and attract audience but failed to become a college classic. we expect a lot from rajkumar hirani, though he had made a good cinema but i still say he was best in his munnabhai series..go if u want to see completely bollywood ishtyle Hindi cinema based on funny college incidents..i simply give 7.5/10.."
"""Aal izz well"".","2 November 2017","10","Never would I have thought that a movie that looked this stupid on paper could have turned out so good. Just looking at the DVD cover would have been enough to turn this film back in but it shows up in IMDb's Top #250 so I thought I'd give it a try. It didn't start out that well for me but before long the movie's magic began to take hold. Not that there's anything daringly new about it's message; it all has to do with believing in one's self and doing what you really want to do with your life after one's formal education is completed.Aamir Khan is a potent anchor for the story of three college friends attending the Imperial College of Engineering, and Rancho's ideas about success don't revolve around getting the best grades but actually learning something. I could see somebody like a younger Matthew Perry performing the role if this was an American film. I wasn't really expecting as much in the way of music from this story, but with the amount of song and dance you could almost call it a musical. The 'Zoobi Doobi' dance number was quite infectious and looked like a lot of fun.Another thing that keeps you engaged is the non-linear story telling technique. But the thing is, you never really get confused when the time line changes from ten years ago to present day. With all the humorous situations presented, this could have easily fallen into slapstick, and it did get close at times, but then the story pulled back with a poignant message or a sobering decision one of the characters had to make. Story threads are tied up that one forgets along the way and that's another cool element. I just thought it was a uniquely creative film with a neat twist at the end with the identity of Rancho. There's even a romance thrown in for our principal player, and when it was over, I had the feeling that this is what ""La La Land"" could have been but never came close."
"Typical Vidhu Vino Chopra type of Comedy FILM","29 December 2009",NA,"Ya, this is just a film and everything is very filmy. Whether it is giving answer to ragging seniors or how easily a Gardner's son reach to the top Engineering college and how easily he gave sacrifices. Then how Runaway bride came into the scene. In Mumbai rain ""CHAMELI"" is sitting in the hospital and Hero is on the road in the rain to make her sister's delivery. Everything is very filmy, nothing should be taken seriously especially by young students. The movie overall is very good and entertaining. Its having a lot like Munna Bhai MMBBS, but instead of Medical Education they picked up Engineering this time. The movie touch some genuine topics which really make this education system worst. How to handle the pressures, and most importantly ""WHEN THEY WILL LEARN -- HOW TO LEARN??"""
"only for idiots","27 December 2009","10","This was a good year for Indian cinema, with movies like Dev.D,Gulal, Siddharth: the Prisoner and Kaminey giving a new direction. I was expecting that 3 idiots will be like a Lassi after having a spicy Panjabi Dinner but alas, Aamir disappointed once again. I do not mind losing my 200 bugs, but surely mind losing my precious hair. This movie is very loosely based upon Five point some one and has done balatakar of it. you will feel sleepy after listening Aamir's boring lecture about, life and education. He makes extra efforts to look like a student which unfortunately failed miserably. In the first half in a scene Aamir goes to one of his room mate's home. That scene makes such a mockery of their poverty that i feel like slapping the director. If that scene is not enough to cause headache, than baby delivery scene in the second half surely does. And than comes the Aamir's great invention, making a inventor for the cars batteries, wow that will make even Einstein proud. The only positive thing about the movie is some two or three good one liner and two songs."
"Haven't Tasted any other movie like This one","27 February 2021","10","This Movie Is an art and Rajkumar hirani is The Artist. The first time I saw this movie, I became a big fan of Amir Khan, although the first time I did not see the whole. After that, every time I watched this movie, I became a fan of each and every character. This is my most watched movie of my life. Loved it!"
"The best Indian movie ever","15 January 2012",NA,"To be brief, THIS IS THE BEST Indian MOVIE EVER CREATED..... I know it is old but I just heard about it recently so I watched it yesterday. I think this movie should be one of the best 250 films in history on IMDb rating. I rated it 10/10 and believe me it worth more than this. I don't want to make spoilers in my review so that you will enjoy every minute of the movie. This movie is 2:44 hours length full of laughter, joy, tears, drama and passion. And of course, the most interesting part of the movie is GENIALITY. I loved every moment of this movie. and I hope to watch a lot of future Indian movies like this. I'm also waiting for Ferrari Ki sawari movie to watch. It is starred by one of the 3 idiots. Thank you India for giving us this brilliant movie."
"Don't BE A STUPID BE AN I.D.I.O.T. ! must watch.","25 December 2009","9","Yesterday i watched 3 I.D.I.O.TS(I Do it On My terms)the most entertaining and simply the best movie of this decade after RDB. a movie with a message(chase excellence success will follow)without loosing its sense of humor,a movie about friendship and love,a movie about flawed education system, a movie about unhealthy competition.this movie is team work ,every one does its part very well. Aamir (what a actor he is!!!)is excellent as Rancho ,Madhavan and Sharman are perfectly in sync(watch both of them in drunk scene), Kareena is OK,Boman played director's character as good as it was possible,Omi was top notch (watch Chamatkar \Balatkar scene),But whenever the team wins credit goes to captain,and here the captain is Rajkumar hirani.He gave 'Jaadu Ki Jhappi 'in MB,'Gandhigiri' in LRMB and now he says 'ALL IZZ WELL' and believe me he is 100% right.Dialogues: Witty with humor and to the point, Chamatkar \Balatkar scene is one of the best comic scenes . Music: Shantanu Moitra's music also have a role in the movie,all the songs come alive on the screen,(watch Zoobie-Doobie and Aal Izz Well)FINAL WORDS: its like a marriage between RDB and Lage Raho Munnabhai. no doubt there is some MASALA but we indians like it . Rating: FIVE POINT SOMETHING OUT OF FIVE.Don't BE A STUPID BE AN I.D.I.O.T. ! must watch."
"All is kinda well for 3 idiots. It was mostly a great feel-good movie.","11 August 2015","9","In a country, where over-achievement is expected & anything deem a normal life is look upon as the idiotic or lazy failure. A lot of Asians feel, that slaving away, their lives, for the chance of extraordinary wealth is the only way, to live, even if it's does not suite their personality. Indeed, the hunger for success and wealth is so engrained in Asian culture, that it's hard to escape, such burdens. It's true, that Asians societies, do put extreme pressure on its members. Often, weighting down on them to a point, that some people feel, that it's too much; causing them to common suicide. So, I can see, why people would want to see this film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. It has a more healthy and positive approach when it comes to a country's wants and don't wants, when it comes to the individual member. Set in an India academia world, 3 Idiots revolves around three students studying in the Imperial College of Engineering, in New Delhi. The first idiot, Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) comes from a poor family and is desperate to pass and get a good job, but lacks the self-esteem to go with his plans. The second idiot, Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), comes from a relatively better family, but has joined engineering to please his family, while he really wants to become a wildlife photographer. The last idiot, Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchhad (Aamir Khan) is a radical-thinking young man, who more willing to challenges the educational system at every step he takes, rather than accenting the harsh-crude teaching practices of the college, often infuriating the headmaster of the school, Viru 'The Virus' Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani). However, Farhan and Raju lost contact with Rancho after graduation. Ten years later, Farhan gets a call from an old enemy colleague of theirs, Chature 'Silencer' Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) who says he has found Rancho. Abandoning everything, Chatur, Farhan and Raju set out on a road trip, to find him. But all is not as it seems. Can the idiots find their friend or will the search end up as a wild goose chase? Watch the movie, to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to look at the film, in a western world view set and say, the Animal House style college scenes, far out-live the present day, road trip movie. I really felt, those scenes were far, more effective, even if the social message was somewhat too broad. I like that, the modern day teaching standards are called into question. It made a very interesting film. Sadly, the movie takes the often funny yet brilliant Patch Adam like, school challenges, and mixed it, with below average Bollywood film dramatics. The movie often moves into such clichés, that it become somewhat emotional jarring to watch. One minute, you're listening to a Bollywood musical dance number, and then, you cut to an emotional, over the top preachy death scene. The pacing for the film is all over the place. It really drags at times. Some of the film's greatest twist comes inappropriate mistimed. You'd know that Raju will survive his suicide attempt since he's alive and well in the present day scenes. You know, that the men will end up, being successful, regardless, what the Virus pull onto them. Don't get me wrong, the twist about Racho's past was pretty good, but the film was pretty predictable. Then, there are the unrealistic over the top scenes that are absolutely nearly implausible in any universe, like the whole stubborn baby scene. Anyways, the acting, throughout the film was pretty good. Each character had a moment to shine. My only problem with the acting is Kareen Kapoor as Pia. She was so disappointing, most of the film. I really don't get her character. Why would she still go after, Suhas (Olivier Lafont), after three-times, where characters warn her, not to!? It doesn't make sense. Plus, that noise ring, she wore, during the film was so distracting. Another thing that kinda hurts the film is the songs. Shantanu Moitra's score is a bit too gimmicky. The song, Zoobi Doobi sounds entertaining, but sounds too similar to other Bollywood songs. The song 'All Izz Well' sounds like it should had been, put in the credits than in the middle of the film. Anyways, I love the over-the-top childish humor. While, the jokes are simple and old. They work mostly within the means of the story. Chatur's engineered speech is by far, the funniest scene in the film. Still, the movie does seem, a bit, one-sided when it comes to condone misbehavior. I'm deeply surprise that the three men, wasn't kick out of the school, within the first couple of minutes in the film. Much of the film's controversy, comes from the fact, that the movie is loosely based on the novel, Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhaget. Any fan of the book, would know, that the film is way different. The suicide message of the book, get somewhat lose in the film. Yes, within the last five years, India has one of the greatest absolute numbers of suicides cases, but here is where the movie get some of the information, wrong. Other countries have the highest rates, overall. It's also untrue, that extreme pressures of academia cause most of India's suicide rates. Farmers are more likely to kill themselves, versus any other professions in India, as list by the World Health Organization. Despite that, the film is fun for the most part. The film is distinctive for featuring real inventions by little-known people. The cinematography is beautiful to look at. I love the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh. The film felt like a typical masala film. It's good to eat, but a bit too spicy, at same moments. No wonder, why this film is one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films ever. Overall: While it's kinda overrated. It's emotional, entertaining and enlightening. In my opinion, it was a somewhat above averaged Bollywood film."
"Breaking my personal racial steryotypes","2 February 2019",NA,"To be honest before seeing this movie I had a very steriotipical view on Indian Cinema. You know, eveyone bursts into dance in the middle of the film and the good guys beating up the bad guys with super hero powers. Or the cheese plots of the poor boy marrying the rich girl... Well Hirani's directing totally shifted my views not only on Indian cinema but also helped me understand and appraciate Indian culture. For me it was easy to relate with the struggles of the charecters to face their family's plans for them as well as to survive the rat race that our lives have turned into, in spite of the fact that I have no asian background. Hirani manages to make a serious case by using explicit humor which makes the movie a real masterpiece."
"One of the best films I had never heard of!","21 March 2021","7","I have a list of top 100 films ever made and honestly most of them don't live up to their hype, 3 idiots however deserves to be on that list 100%. This film has everything from a diverse cast, to a realistic respectful romance, to accurate and emotional portrayal of suicide and burdens parents put on their children to a well written strong and funny female character and last but not least an amazingly written main character who is played fantastically well. I had not heard of this film but am so I glad i found it! I laughed, I cried, I was utterly confused and i will not be forgetting this film anytime soon. To anyone who has not seen this film GO AND WATCH IT! You won't regret it."
"Simply Awesome!! You gotta watch it to believe it!","25 December 2009","7","After some really bad experiences with Hindi Movies especially Mangal Pandey, I stopped watching any Hindi movie during first 3 days of its release and normally downloads them from internet except Aamir's movies. Though I have been eagerly waiting to watch 3 Idiots but still I read some 6-7 reviews on different websites before going to the movie. All of the reviews were positive so I decided to spend my money this time on theatre on first day first show.Pros1. Lots of hilarious scenes a. The Teacher's Day speech By Omi: Even if I give you the whole script of the scene, I can bet that you will definitely burst out laughing while watching this scene (an aged sardar had to go out of theatre because he couldn't handle so much laughter in the scene) . b. Scene at Sharman's house where these 3 had dinnerc. Kareena's Sister wedding scened. And lots of one liners too2. Awesome acting by Aamir After watching Ghajini, you will be amazed to see how this guy managed to transform himself into a 20+ college going student and actually looks like one. The spontaneity especially in the scene when he talked to Boman Irani during the cremation of a student makes him the best actor bollywood has ever produced 3. Camaraderie between Aamir, Sharman and MadhvanAfter RDB, this triplet has done it yet again!! See the scene where they are drinking on stairs and Sharman and Madhvan challenge Aamir4. Chemistry between Aamir & Kareena All efforts goes to Aamir for this who manages to look so young that this pair never looks odd and chemistry between them was also amazing5. Realizations in the characters All the characters except Rancho (Simply because I haven't find or heard of such a genius till now) in the film seems real and you can relate them to one or other in your real life. This brings the film all the more close to your heart6. Message of the film A well-deserved strike on the existing education system where rot learning has become part of the life of every student (including myself who followed the blind race of Engineering & MBA without knowing what I really want to do) 7. Finally, each and every character in the movie fits in his/her role and has gone their true potential. There are many scenes to see that too like Sharman's dilemma and breakdown during one of his interaction with Boman, The way Boman's carries himself as an intelligent but cynic principal, Omi's character etc.8. SongsHonestly telling, before watching the movie I didn't like the songs very much but after the movie I am in love with them especially Give me some sunshine, All Izz well and Zoobi DoobiCons1. Kareena eloping from her marriageThis seems a little bit dramatic in an otherwise realistic movie but considering the whole movie I can bear with this five minutes part and in fact going by the reaction of other audiences, you will love this scene also. 2. Mona Singh Delivery SceneAgain, the thing which was indigestible for me was how a person can manage to create a suction device via a vacuum cleaner in such a short time and that makes Rancho an unrealistic person but I guess this is Indian Cinema and no movie can be a complete reality (this applies to Munna Bhai Series, Aamir's all movies, in fact I should not be talking about realism in Shahrukh's movie) Overall, this movie is worth every single penny of your ticket and you won't regret spending even 300 bucks on this movie. This is guaranteed!!"
"Feel Good","25 January 2010",NA,"On Christmas day my family and I went to watch a new Bollywood movie called 3 Idiots. Starring Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor. The majority of the film is a flash back of the college days of three young boys, whose future had been decided at birth. Correlating with with the Indian stereotype of: whenever a boy is born he will become an engineer. The moral of the film is that when one finds what they truly love to do, work will become play. This moral is presented to the audience through numerous comedic and emotional situations very well placed throughout the story line. Although much of the story is very predictable, I believe the film was supposed to be this way, as the point of the film was to teach the audience a very important lesson: do what you love to do. As with all Indian films, this one also had the token 'love' part, which no Indian movie seems to be able to function without. This is a recommended watch, whether it is in theaters or on DVD, this movie is a definite 'feel good' film that the whole family will enjoy. It will also be released in its entirety on YouTube after 12 weeks."
"Don't judge this book by its cover!","3 July 2011","9","This movie hit on all cylinders. It was fun, funny, deep, intelligent, thought provoking, and seriously entertaining. It is not a dumb comedy, rather a very smart (and humorous) look at the struggles of engineering students in India.I thought I would have trouble with the subtitles, but after about 10- minutes I was completely 100% engrossed in the movie. The wife loved every bit of it.My single and only criticism is the length of the movie. I believe there were one or two too many situations which kind of caused the movie to drag.Otherwise I thoroughly loved it.Do not be fooled by the idiotic picture on the cover of this movie. And the first 5-minutes of the movie are not indicative of the brilliance of the rest of the film. It is not stupid humor (even though I like stupid humor).You will leave this movie being glad you watched it. Trust me."
"Engineering College Redemption","25 December 2009","9","The movie is supposed to be based on Chetan Bhagat's guideline for IITs Five Point Someone.It not entirely true to it.and in the end it does take a turn that is reminiscent of the ever loving Shawshank Redemption in more ways than one.such as Sharman Joshi's candid confession in an interview besides the end!The film manages a comic depth,what it, at much of the times lacks is emotional depth.It treats issues too naively perhaps.It creates caricatures out of Bhagat's characters.it does hinder character development.Boman Irani's Dean Viru Sahastrabudhhe(VIRUS) did remind me of his own Dr.Asthana in Hirani's debut Munnabhai M.B.B.S. Asthana's funny guffaws were character traits but Virus hasn't any he tries to be whatever is required.He is funny,he is ruthless but never as formidable as Asthana. 3I is not par stereotypes thus is predictable.It also delves in silliness and goes from melodramatic extremes to comic extremes in seconds.But all said the movie is just too funny. I have not laughed so much in days.Its certainly written better than the novel(apparently not a difficult thing to do).Lead Performances are very good too.In the end its easily lovable but forgettable unlike LRMunnabhai.Its not at all a bad movie but maybe just not brilliant.Lead Actor's own Taare Zameen Par would be a brilliant document on education system.I rate it 7/10."
"MBBS, LAGE RAHO were straight from the heart of Hirani, this one is from businessman.","29 December 2009",NA,"The last one month, movie lovers enjoyed best movies like PAA, AVATAR, and now 3 idiots. these three movies are having different genre but provided best entertainment. 3 idiots is also good movie but not the best as per my view. Acting wise Amir khan is best. sharman, r. madhavan , kareena,boman irani did fine job too. Now where i differ others is the whole idea of movie is adaptation of MUNNABHI MBBS on different background. After interval the movie is like munnabhai MBBS part 2. same situations and scenes. when i came out of the hall i felt like director decided the start and end of the movie first, and then wrote the script, created the situations, characters later. This is my opinion of the film, this may hurt others but when i think about it as Rajkumar hirani film. I don't expect the same tried and tested scenes in his movie. For me the second half of movie was weaker part. I hope Rajkumar hirani and abhijat joshi will work on better scripts next time. Overall the movie is timepass and watchable but not the masterpiece, we have seen better work from Rajkumar Hirani in his first two movies"
"A Must Watch!","25 December 2009","7","Rajkumar Hirani... the name is enough to create an excitement in any cinema-fan alive. Munnabhai series have been awesome films, and his latest offering '3 Idiots' is another Masterstroke from this genius.I have no idea how 5-point-someone is, all I know is that '3 Idiots' is an amazing/awesome/inspiring film. A treat of a film! A film that is rich in emotions, A Film that leaves behind a great moral. The Youth are sure to worship this Film, and that will make this film a blockbuster. Cancel anything you're planning to do till the 31st, watch '3 Idiots', it's worth your time and money. Hirani and Joshi's script is simply superb. Through Humor how many rights and wrongs are said. I really loved the way Hirani showed us Sharman's family. A typical 1950's family, it's hilarious as well as genius.The film has Superb Performances: Aamir is fantastic as Funsok Wang Do. He's a delight every time he appears on screen and delivers his careers finest work. Maddy excels, he's astounding in the sequence when he shares his heart with his father. Sharman Joshi is good, yet again. Omi is a Masterstroke. A surprise packet, his speech sequence is sure to be remembered forever! Kareena is weak. Boman Irani is mind-blowing as the vicious head. He leaves you speechless in the scene when he awards Aamir The Pen. Mona is average.The Music is decent, with 'All Izz Well' being a complete chart-buster. The cinematography is perfect. All other departments are satisfactory.Watch this film right now..."
"I Laughed! I Cried! And I'm giving this a 10!","7 March 2013","7","When I was looking through IMDb's Top 250 movie list and saw a movie called ""3 Idiots"", I was surprised. Why would a movie with such a bad title be voted so highly? I went in thinking this would be India's version of Animal House or American Pie. But after watching the film, I was in love! It is so much more than the usual college story of young guys getting drunk, flunking classes, and getting back at their superiors. It is an extremely well-made film about doing what you love and facing your fears. The acting is incredible by the ensemble cast. The script is funny and poignant at the same time. Even the scenery is breathtaking. Although the length of the film is pretty long and has some quirky musical numbers, 3 Idiots is a delight. It is worth the watch!"
"The only movie that made me laugh and cry so hard...","3 August 2013",NA,"As you can see, I'm a huge movie buff. However, my scope is strictly limited to English-speaking movies. In other words, I have scruples watching foreign movies in subtitles. Nevertheless, I'm completely in the state of idleness for the whole summer. What's even worse, I've run out of American movies to watch since I've basically watched every movie that suits my palate. A friend of mine hugely recommended this Indian movie for me to watch. I was completely reluctant in the beginning to say the least. The title sounds like a Jim-Carrey-parody-like comedy which nothing in it can be literally taken serious. On account of my preference for serious movies, I tend to ignore those ""silly"" comedies. However, my friend's non-stop imploring drove me nuts. To humor him, I decided to give the movie a try.The beginning was kinda within my expectation. Two goofy ""idiots"" started to turn the world around them upside down by extremely over-the- top actions(stopping a flight, hitchhiking a limousine), they reached an observatory of The Imperial College of Engineering, aka ICE, their alma mater, to meet a friend they've lost contact for six years. Only to find another classmate, Chatur, who started to boast himself for his success over some guy named Rancho. Until then, I was feeling this movie was no different than any other comedies. However, the following sequences kicked in and I was completely blown away. It all started with a magnificent melody that unveiled the main storyline.The main character, Rancho, was a guy who was enrolled in ICE. However, he was totally different than any other students. Instead of studying by rote like any other students, he focused more on the practical aspect of the knowledge. As a result, he was able to shock a bully in the groin with electricity. There was another student like him, who was working on his own helicopter project. However, their director, Virus(a nickname of course) wouldn't allow him to graduate. The heartbreaking rejection ultimately led to the student's suicide. Rancho realized the education system in India was extremely flawed. It suppressed the personalities of all the students, focusing on nothing but the grades. Rancho decided to step up against it. He kept challenging his teachers and even the director. He made 2 good friends, Farhan and Raju(the two goofy idiots in the beginning) and really inspired them. Later, he met a girl named Pia, who turned out to be the director's daughter. A lot of clashes occurred in Rancho's intent to change the education system and even his friendship was put to test. The ending of the movie was so touching that anybody would shed tears from their eyes, with a small twist that would made everything pleasant once again.Overall, it's really a sweet movie. It can be a comedy at times, with a lot of over-the-top action from Rancho and his friends. However, it's a lot more than that. It's more of an insight into the education system of India, which is similar to those in the likes of other Asian countries like China, Japan and Korea. It can at times be so heart- warming that your tears can't help but surge out like waterfalls. It can be a musical too, with a lot of exotic dances and songs which are common among Indian movies. Great film. Totally change my impression for Indian movies. Easily 10/10."
"Americans, Enough, This movie is that good!!!!!!!","19 May 2013","2","Well, at least it is in Asian's Mind. It's SO GODDAMN GOOD for Asians.You don't get the high school thing so you think it's overrated. Well, Dark Knight and The Avengers are overrated for us because we don't get the superheroes thing. But so what? Still, a lot of people love it, so Stop Taking Your Personal feelings as The Lethal Truth. To make you understand better. Let me tell you something about the high school thing. If you have studied in Chinese or Indian High school you will understand what's all about the suicide and sad plot. Life was like a pis of sh!t. You have to wake up at 6:30 and go to bed after like 10:30, you can never choose your class, you can never say anything that against the teacher, you can never be in relationship with boys or girls. Right here, NO PARTY, NO PROM, NO NOTHING. All you have to do and all you can do is study and study, and the only way to make your life better is to get good grades. Because of the hard works and lack of fun, you're totally exhausted while the teachers and parents keep complains that you're lazy. And what's even funnier, is that 80% of what you have struggled to learn has nothing to do with your future life. So it simply sucks here.That's why we love the film, it showed our mind, it's not a perfect movie. But it make us laugh and cry. This movie is 9.1 in douban.com(A Really Famous Website in China)It's 8 out of 10 for us, and even for some of you. For some of you, it's 6 or 7 out of 10. So, it's 8.1 for average. NOTHING IS WRONG. So, please, try to understand."

"A Nutshell Review: 3 Idiots","26 December 2009","10","When I told a friend that 3 Idiots is the best film this festive period, he told me it takes an idiot to be able to tell one, and that I saw myself in the film. If anything, I'll take that as a compliment, as the film is about self-actualization, or the simple fact that it's a wake up call in this rat race of a world that we live in, that we lose sight of things that matter in the pursuit of success. It's a wake up call that we should be pursuing Excellence instead, which in the work environment one gets easily drowned in mediocrity, or blind faith that success follows without putting in too much hard work.Set predominantly in the varsity days and told in chunks of flashback, this film will allow you to reminisce about a time where life was nothing but exams, lectures, and that paper chase, either making the grade or having to repeat. But there's also probably that one person, or a few if you're lucky, whom you'll meet on campus that will help you directly or indirectly, shape your outlook, thinking and just about forming long lasting bonds, whose interaction with will shape your character just before entering the workforce.3 Idiots tell of such a friendship, amongst 3 buddies Farhan (R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi), two mediocre students who just scrape through, and the one huge influence in their lives, ace student Rancho (Aamir Khan), the livewire of the trio who irks the Dean of Imperial College of Engineering (modelled after the famed Indian Institute of Technology), Professor Viru (Virus), played by Boman Irani. In fact, it's something like a Hindi equivalent of the local I Not Stupid with its critique on the educational system, but done with a lot more finesse, fun and without sledgehammering its ideals down your throat.The gist of the disparity here is the concept of learning how to learn, or teaching somebody how to fish compared to just giving the students the fish. It's a reminder that knowledge gathering goes beyond just doing so for exams, and the techniques of blindly cramming will do one not much good later on. It's about the application of knowledge for the real world than to answer papers, and the joy of acquiring such knowledge. It's the 3 Idiots versus the Professor, and their peer Chatur ""Silencer"" (Omi Vaidya who played the role with glee, as the peer bootlicker that everyone loves to hate) who throws down the gauntlet to Rancho as to who will eventually be the more successful of the lot.What made 3 Idiots work remarkably, is the excellent chemistry between the leads. Aamir Khan, the big name as he is, doesn't upstage his co-stars R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi, as their characters get into various forms of shenanigans in college. Instead they complement one another in their roles, and thanks to makeup, look very much comfortable as their aged selves, and their younger teenage ones through closely cropped hair, and outfits. Aamir aces the role of Rancho as the boy who gets ahead of the pack without really trying and at times being perceived as both the smarty pants and the troublemaker of his cohort, though his sudden disappearance after graduation has made his good friends try to track him down, albeit unsuccessfully. The film also doesn't take itself too seriously when the time calls for it, switching quite playfully to ramp up its funny moments, even at times breaking the fourth wall when telling the story of Raju's background (in black and white melodrama no less). The jokes here worked wonders as well, as do the couple of twists that roll along in the 2nd act after the interval, which is somewhat telling of the narrative depth that the film possessed. Songs were breezy and plenty of fun, and I personally enjoyed Aal Izz Well (All Is Well) best, a chant that the Idiots adopted from Rancho, who uses it to calm his heart when it's filled with anxiety and fear. I think it works.Affairs of the heart though are kept at a bare minimum, when Rancho falls for the daughter of Professor Viru, Pia (Kareena Kapoor). While they start off in quite testy terms, things start to thaw when Pia sees Rancho for who he is, except that the secret Rancho keeps threatens to keep them permanently apart. And that is unless the other 2 pals could help it in their quest to locate Rancho. Everything falls into place at the end, especially telling of the second act when you learn of this secret at the cliffhanger prior to the interval, and this provides yet another emotional sucker punch to your gut when themes like friendship lasting forever starts entering the picture.Chase excellence and success will follow; this film lived up to that tagline in being one of the most excellent I've watched this year. Amongst all the film offerings put out this festive season, my choice for the most uplifting, the most hopeful and a jolly entertaining ride all around with elements of everything only a Bollywood film is renowned for, is this one. Don't miss it, and it goes directly, albeit a late entry, as a contender for my top films of the year!"
"I never thought I could love a three-hour comedy","18 January 2022","10","By now, I've seen at least 80 Bollywood films, largely thanks to Netflix and Covid. I'm still not used to the extra 30-45 minutes they tend to run compared to analogous Western productions. Longer comedies test my patience more than the action flicks. That's not a cultural gap. I've complained many times about Judd Apatow's excessive footage diluting the enjoyment his casting and material could have delivered in a tighter package.This delightful film transcends all norms. It's so well-written and performed that the time flew. The mix of savvy and silly adds up to a joyful package. The smattering of musical numbers kept the fun going somewhat more smoothly than has often been the case. The early conflicts hilariously established characters, setting up the rest. Several moments elicited more tears than I would have wanted others to see leaking from my orbs. The script builds to several terrific callbacks. I'm glad I checked IMDb's Top 250 list and decided to work my way through most of the dozen or two I'd missed. This one truly deserves its place among them."
"Idiotic Times 3","20 February 2010",NA,"'3 Idiots' tried to walk the same path as Hirani's debut 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.' but while 'M.B.B.S.' was entertaining in parts and stays consistent, '3 Idiots' is a mess. The film itself lacks direction and the story tries to tackle too many issues, each of which are poorly and superficially handled. It is easy to notice that the film tries to be another 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.'. While some of the jokes are funny, most of them are ripped off from unacknowledged sources (mostly European commercials). I suppose it's become a new trend in Bollywood to rip off old and obscure commercials since the writer lacks an original idea. The songs are easy on the ears but forgettable. Aamir Khan is miscast. He is too old for the part and does not convince at all as a university student. Madhavan too looks old for his part but not as poorly cast as Aamir. Sharman Joshi may look the part but he does overact. Boman Irani is irritating and Kareena Kapoor is strictly average. I'm surprised that so many people are calling this the best movie of the decade. '3 Idiots' is bad."
"Clearly the best Hindi movie of 2009.. must watch","30 December 2009","9","I watched '3 idiots' on the Christmas Day. Being an Aamir Khan fan the expectations were huge. The movie is excellent, absolutely fun filled and hilarious but deviates from its main idea of Education system after the intermission. The depiction of education system of India is completely true where each and every prof. is interested only in the fact that you have mugged up his lessons on not. Being an IITian myself I can assure you of this. Aamir Khan is awesome, Sharman and Madhavan are also good as usual. Boman Irani rocks again with his stand out performance. Kareena Kapoor is OK considering her not so important role. The stand out scene of this movie is clearly Omi's 'Balatkaar' speech.But considering Raju Hirani previous works, this movie can't be called his best. Its like Hirani hit a double hundred in his 1st one(Munnabhai MBBS), a 50-60 in his 2nd and a 90* in this.Considering all these, I would go with an 7 out of a 10 and thumbs up for this movie. You can surely spend two hundred bucks, it is worth it."
"An undeniable masterpiece","29 June 2013","9","One of my students - a girl, once asked me how would she know if she has found the right guy. I told her I don't know how but I shared with her a method to sieve out the useless ones. Get them to watch 2 films with you and watch for their reactions. If the first reaction is ""I don't watch silly Japanese cartoons and musical Hindi flicks,"" discard them like used tissue papers because they are not worth your time. Why?  Because they already have deep-set perceived ideas and worse of all, they will not even give it a chance, not even for you. Then if they do want to watch them, watch for their reactions. If they give snide and self-important remarks, hello-goodbye them out of your life. The 2 movies that I suggested to her were My Neighbour Totoro and 3 Idiots. I saw 3 Idiots again today and I am surprised it's only my second time. But it feels like only just yesterday that I got to know the 3 musketeers - Farhan, Raju and Rancho. I think that's one of the reason why it's so successful - their easy chemistry.  The 3 characters' arcs are so divisive (each focusing on different aspects of the pursuit of education) but yet so intertwined because of their deep friendship. At the end, I remember walking out of the cinema learning life lessons from a master. This time round watching it at home, I realize why I love it so much. Most films only have one central theme and all the plot revolves around that. 3 Idiots has bigger aspirations - it was deftly balancing multiple themes. It didn't only delve on aspects of education, it also hit on subjects like superficiality, parenting, treating people right etc.  In my opinion, one of the reasons why the film succeeds is that it wasn't preachy. It didn't need 10 minutes to force the schmaltz down your throat, it just throws the idea out there and it hits home. Take a look at Jack Neo's I'm Not Stupid, same big subject but you will vomit out all the top-down schmaltz by the end of the movie. I think 3 Idiots realizes that these ideas for living your life and the pursuit of excellence are in all of our consciousness... We all know them but we just never act against them and allowed it to permeate our lives from way back.  The film only needs to throw out the ideas, package them in a fresh approach and it hits the home run. None of the ideas needed to linger longer than it was necessary. I love the narrative structure which is actually a road movie.  Most directors will just do tough love in a linear manner. 3 Idiots uses flashback very effectively. If you think about it, we are only seeing Farhan's version of Rancho for 95% of the film. How do we know that's the real version? The real Rancho only appears right at the end.  The use of screwball comedy works remarkably well too. In fact, the tone switches like the mind of an idiot suffering from a tri-polar complex. For instance, in the ending of the second act, the birthing of Mona's baby in the midst of the biggest flood and rain. I loathe these birthing scenes in movies. Always feel like some fake big life affirming moment but seeing how it is handled here I am so awed. Not pretentious and look at how the tone switches like crazy - from sad (expulsion from ICE), to tension (no transport to the hospital and no electricity), to full-on problem solving (the theme of what education is for culminates here), to comedy, to celebration, back to total sadness again ('death' of baby) and to the closing metaphor of ""All Izz Well"". Freaking brilliant. It was then I realized the director builds up the ""All Izz Well"" metaphor all through the film until that point. And it didn't end there. That last speech by the professor to Rancho in the driving rain closed up, no, bookended what actually began in their first meeting where Rancho asks why didn't the astronauts use a pencil in space. This is what CLASS is about and this film has truckloads of it. The only misstep for me is the romance angle between Pia and Rancho wasn't totally satisfying. Their cute meet is really awesome but if Pia has learned anything from Rancho, why would she still want to marry Mr Pricetag in the end?  I know it was just a narrative ploy to get all the parties together for the final journey to meet Rancho but it didn't feel right for me.  But really, I am just nitpicking. I apologize if I let out some spoilers but seriously if you have not seen this, you must be the type of person that I mentioned about in the first paragraph."
"Good, not great","24 October 2010",NA,"This movie is very much in the DCH mould, but not nearly as good. It begins very impressively but gradually begins to stray off and by the end goes way overboard.It may come as a disappointment to those who pride it as a movie that pinpoints what's wrong with our society that the extraordinary nature of events in the movie do not strike a chord with real life regardless of the country or society under consideration. For those who look up to it as the beginning of a trend of quality satire movies in bollywood, I am afraid its a false dawn.I've seen and thoroughly enjoyed many zany comedies, but those movies are different because they don't try to simulate real world situations unlike a movie based on a serious subject like 3 Idiots. The seriousness of the movie's theme was not reflected in the storyline and/or direction of the movie. Having said that, it is enjoyable to watch, being full of lighthearted humour, which makes it worth a watch and I wonder had it stuck to a saner storyline, it could really have been the masterpiece that many have made it out to be anyways.Also, since its focused largely, if not entirely on Aamir Khan and the other two so called central characters don't play enough of a role, the movie doesn't seem to warrant the title 3 Idiots.Its kind of disappointing to see people adulating and hailing this movie as something which is class apart, if it is so, we can and will have to raise that class."
"Easily one of the most overrated films on IMDb","26 February 2016","6","The script is the biggest problem with this film. It is filled with clichés and unoriginal jokes. The theme and message of the film is spelled out for the audience a million times. It should be more subtle and realistic. The sequence of events is entirely predictable.Additionally, there is nothing exceptional about any other element of the film in my opinion. There is nothing impressive about the camera work. There is nothing impressive about set design or costume design. There is nothing impressive about the acting or characterization.It is emotionally manipulative using every trick in the book and there is nothing to enjoy if you do not fall for that. How it is so far up IMDb's top 250 is beyond me."
"Very long and heartwarming","1 June 2020","6","I'm not familiar with Indian films so this was a good introduction. The characters are funny, if one-dimensional, and the storyline is heartfelt. There is some satire of education and society that I can get behind."
"Amazing!!!!","19 January 2010",NA,"If i could give this movie higher then a 10. I would. I think anyone gives this movie a low marking, should not be allowed to judge movies, maybe even keep them out of the theaters!!! This movie is funny, charming, loving, did i mention funny? Will make u tear from laughing as well as in other moments. One second you'll be laughing, and the next second you'll feel their pains. Lots of ups and downs. awesome movie........must watch for everyone.Amir khan has always been great. Old classic movies to all the new ones. He has broadened his horizon. Amazing actor who plays serious parts as well as goofy roles. He kind of reminded me of Johnny Depp. Man is brilliant. The Dean of the school was also hilarious. I know that had to be a hard role to play, but wow did he pull it off.Again, must watch for young, old, teens. If you have been through college, it will definitely hit the spot a little more.. Enjoy!"
"amazing movies","29 December 2009","10","I absolutely LOVED this movie. I was one of two or three 'white' people in the Cinema, and waiting in the line i got a lot of 'looks', but I'm speechless to how good this movie was!!! Aamir just keeps getting better!!!! TZP was amazing, Ghajani was amazing and now 3 Idiots... AMAZING!!! cant wait to own it on DVD!!! I might even go see it again at the cinema!! I've now seen about 5 Bollywood movies at the cinema, and i own about 30 movies on DVD. I'm an Aussie what LOVES Bollywood & Aamir Khan!!! What movies is next for Aamir? I'm sure it will be another to touch our hearts, i'd love to see his body ripped like in Ghajani again! 3 IDIOTS ROCKS!!!"
"Significant and entertaining","10 December 2020","10","This is a significant Bollywood movie, but for European or American viewers, it is best compared to a binge-watched colorful Hollywood miniseries by style, melodramatic and light in tone, but much more filled with meaning. It celebrates Gypsy style music and ingenuity in poverty while criticizing strict education systems of high Asiatic pressure and parental authority which stifles creativity by senseless rot-learning even at top institutions. Quite entertaining and watchable, and different in style - but not at all inferior in quality - to the top Hollywood production, it has some authentic light humorous touches and some intense melodrama - an over the top Bollywood type soap opera that is somewhat a significant social critique at the same time."
"A fun watch!","21 December 2014",NA,"This is my first real exposure to Bollywood and I gotta say it's a lot of fun! A lot of what is portrayed in this film about life in engineering school is very real and true, and I think this is what makes this movie very easy to relate to for a lot of people. Yet at the same time, there are moments of comedy, sheer fun, Bollywood dancing and falling in love. Whether you regularly watch Bollywood or not, I think this is a great film regardless. Original and interesting storyline mixed in with some moments of cheesiness. It's nearly 3 hours long, but it's certainly not a drag. A good movie for if you're looking for something fun and light-hearted."
"The most fun I have ever had watching a movie!","13 April 2011","6","3 idiots offers a great deal of fun. Indeed, one of the best movies I have ever seen! Its experience is simple, yet it's great in every aspect! I absolutely loved the fact that this film had it all, wonderful atmosphere, brilliant acting, lovely inspiring songs and a surprisingly thrilling story! During the movie, I laughed and cried A LOT!! The combination of the movie aspects was astonishing. I never thought I would enjoy an Indian movie as much as I enjoyed Slumdog Millionaire, but this one simply surpasses every other Indian movie. The story is touching, inspiring and funny.. at the same time!! This movie is plain FUN. It's about family, friendship and a little bit of romance. It had a great deal of great family moments that are still stuck in my mind till now (I saw the movie a week ago!) Plus it deals with friendship and its impacts on a person's life, and what a brilliant friendship story we saw in this movie! One of the greatest friendship stories captured on cinema mixed joyously with top-notch fun. I recommend this movie to anyone who actually wants to enjoy a real movie experience that has it all, in other words.. this movie is recommended for EVERYONE! Acting: 10, Direction: 9, Soundtrack: 10, Story: 10, Overall rating: A decent 10!Don't just rent it, OWN it and show it to friends who like to enjoy a fun movie!"
"my take on the film 3 idiots","6 June 2013","6","3 idiots i a great film, that portrays 3 boys in college and the funny antics they get up to while in this process. The film shows how learning can be made fun, and as long as you love what you do, you will succeed in it. but the film isn't all fun and games, the movie portrays the flaws that India currently have in their educational system, it also shows that not everyone can do what they love as the pressure put upon them by their families can be an argument to persuade anyone, the movie shows a suicide, this really shocks the viewers, and the fact is that the film isn't a fictional one and when a person fails, they do commit suicide, I'm not saying all do but quite a few. They also show the hypocrisy of class and how though everyone thought the main character was a wealthy heir he was no more than a servant posing for the heir who could not even understand engineering. The birth of the headmasters grandchild makes the viewer see that the educational system can change, along with the people running it, and the stereotype of a woman being a doctor and a man becoming an engineer becomes to deteriorate. All in all a great film, and worthy for its position in the top 250 films"
"Good, not outstanding","25 February 2010",NA,"3 Idiots is definitely an over-hyped good movie. A lot of expectations were associated with the movie since it was going to come from Raju Hirani, the Munnabhai director and Aamir Khan, the perfectionist actor (and producer and director). Definitely the movie is a good one but it falls short of the pre-release expectations. It is a nice timepass as the entertainment value is quite high. The inherent message for the youth to pursue their passion instead of joining the rat race is also exemplary. However, giving a second look to the movie (after the laughters and the first time euphoria have calmed down), several flaws can be seen very easily in the storyline as well as the treatment. Loosely inspired by the novel Five Point Someone, the movie has shown the lead characters as black or white instead of grey, the real life ones. The director has played with the characters as puppets in his hands instead of allowing them to develop normally. The best example is of Chatur (played excellently by the hitherto less known actor Omi). The movie has exaggerated several things and the biggest drawback of the movie in my opinion is that the storyteller challenges the intelligence of the viewers at several places. There are several incidents in the movie totally indigestible for a sensible viewer. Perhaps Raju Hirani conveniently overlooked the fact that his audience is not the David Dhawan's audience who is expected to leave the brains at home before leaving for the theatre.3 Idiots (even the name is not appropriate), falters at many points and on many counts. However taking the plus points first, it is recommended as a good comedy successful in making you laugh. Further the music is good and hummable. The song about the character of Rancho played with the titles is quite meaningful and melodious. Choreography is quite good. The performances are excellent right from Aamir Khan to the actors getting the lowest footage in the movie. The message for the students to give precedence to knowledge over marks and follow their passion is definitely admirable. The movie impresses and moves the viewer deeply at certain places. It does not give you a chance to identify its loopholes and weaknesses while viewing it for the first time. Very entertaining and gripping indeed.But the minus points are too many to categorise the movie as an outstanding (which has been unjustifiably done by several established reviewers). It is necessary (and relatively easy too) to differentiate between an outstanding movie and a good movie. 3 Idiots is good, not outstanding. It is flawed, not flawless. Making fun of a dedicated student (even when he is a book-worm) is not proper, nor is it to blame the head of an institution for a pressurised student's suicide (and an ignorant father for his non-communicative son's suicide). Suicide cannot be given precedence over communication of your anguish and pains. It cannot be glamorised as well. Showing the head of the college as doing ridiculous things just to make fun of him or portray him in bad light is also not a commendable thing. A scientist with 400 patents being so unknown and unidentified and a girl not marrying for ten years, yet not making any meaningful (and successful) effort to search for her lost love, besides males playing midwives and managing childbirth with the help of a vacuum-cleaner are a few among several irritating things shown in the movie. Rancho's distorting the speech written in Roman for Chatur and making him a laughing stock just because of his lack of proper knowledge of Hindi language cannot be justified either.Even on the laughter dimension, the movie is not a perfect one. Showing the male students time and again in the toilet or pointing at their asses looks disgusting after the first time. The excessive use of the word - balatkar (rape) does not allow the movie to be watched comfortably with all the family members. Does the moviemaker want the children (because the movie has been given a U certificate by the Indian Censor Board) to know the meaning of balatkar (rape) before the proper age ?Raju Hirani had impressed the Indian audience with his close-to-heart Munnabhai movies. However in this movie, he has not succeeded in living upto his reputation and the pre-release hype of the movie. The movie is excellent in parts only. It's irritating at many places. Overall it is good. It could have been a better one by all means."
"A really fun and enlightening movie","16 January 2013","3","I've decided to start this review by describing what happened during the screening of this movie in one of my University class to demonstrate just how interesting this movie really is.Our lecturer has decided to replace one of our classes on a weeknight and during the class, he has decided to show us this movie. The class started at 8 p.m. and as my class consist of students who are used to skipping classes (even the afternoon ones) or are prone to leaving early (including myself), I was expecting the class to be almost empty by the end of it.By the end of the class, which was about 11.30 p.m., none of the students actually left the lecture hall because everyone really enjoy the movie so much and all of us wanted to finish the movie because it was fun, interesting and inspiring.The movie has tackled an important aspect in the modern society: Why do we study ? Is it only for the sake of getting a well-paid job in the future ? Or was it for the knowledge or interest ? This movie had us questioning our purpose of studying and whether we are doing it for the sake of our future job, to fulfill our parents' demands and expectation or to feed our hunger for knowledge ?All of us go to school for a different reason, some to make friends or to hang out with their friends, there are some who really enjoys learning new things everyday but many are those who go to school just for the sake of completing their studies.The movie tries to bring out this point through humor, loads of them ! The movie is really funny and through unfolding the events by looking into the past and present, it avoids being too straight forward which in my opinion, keeps the audience interested in the movie without getting bored.I really love the movie and has always recommended people to watch it, in fact, everyone that I know who have watched the movie loved it. This movie is really one of my favorite movies of all time."
"It is NOT a great movie, it IS a good movie though","24 December 2009","3","OK so just to make it clear, I do think this movie is very funny! As a matter of fact, its hilarious. My only problem with the movie is ---1) Unoriginal - I understand that the original concept was developed by Mr Hirani himself, but nonetheless, its not fresh. Might as well call it ""Munnabhai BSc - THE DEJA VU"". I guess since the west has the 3 stooges, and 3 musketeers, we need something too right? 2) Old Jokes - the common urban legend of spending millions of dollars on a space pen instead of using a pencil, and ""how does a motor start"", and the fact that indians only want their children to be engineers or doctors (we do have actors, cricketers, and politicians, don't we?), just too old. 3) Unrealistic - I don't even feel the need to explain this one. (I think Bollywood directors firmly believe in an old adage- ""Everything is possible"" and they follow it religiously in every movie. Be it bringing a dead to life by saying ""AAL IZZ WELL"" or stopping a wedding at the last second (how does this not get boring, i can name 10 movies that have already done this and i don't even watch too many bollywood movies) on a bright note, it is very funny (yes the jokes are old, but they are executed pretty well), please watch it and i apologize for being such a hater. I am just giving my 2 cents. Plus, I think everyone did a great job in the movie. I laughed my ass off on few occasions, but so did I while watching American Pie...and so I strongly disagree with those who think this movie is a masterpiece. it is not. 6.5/10."
"Munna zameen par","29 December 2009",NA,"Well, Aamir is proving, he also just cannot keep doing only great movies, and needs the dough. From QSQT, he can do a student role. No big deal. Have we run out of jokes, with all these laughter challenges and standup fresh material, we need to use, how does a induction motor start? This is three smart guys, thinking audience is a bunch of idiots. It is a run of the mill, bollywood, melodramatic, no substance, BS....are they running out of slapstick, that they had to try the peeing scene twice or did they like the joke soooo much? Besides, Boman Irani, who takes his every role seriously and delivers top notch performance, and does it professionally, the rest is run of the mill. Just because you make posters that look like tarey zameen par, the movie does not become one. You know what is funny? Khan says do not be pressurized to deliver, and do your own thing....but looks like he is so pressurized, and he cannot do anything different, and keeps falling for Mr Ideal, and student....Mr Khan...when you start making smart movies, do not for once, assume the audience is dumb or idiots. WE have the rest of the 99 movies already doing that...and if the movie is not ready, let us wait.... sucking a baby out with a vacuum that runs on car battery based inverters....hmm....400 patents....and you want us to believe.... why did the lap top screen go off, when the power went? I thought they work on batteries? In which airline, the programs on entertainment system start, before take off? Looks like they needed some pocket money urgently, and made this all in a haste....i have not read the book...I am sure there is a lot of bollywood...may be one day I will ask someone who has read the book.Oscar? forget it."
"The Fun Side of Bollywood","10 January 2014","8","There was an article published by Time magazine some years ago. It explained that while China enjoys a robust population and a rigorous educational system (for those who can afford it), the spontaneous and creative aspects of Chinese culture has been subverted. It's been marginalized so much so that American business specialists have been asked to speak at some of china's most prestigious companies to ""teach"" creativity. The article presumes that Chinese middle-managers have had so many concepts and facts drilled into them in school that they are unable to think outside of the box like Americans.Subtle racism and cold war paranoia aside, the article does have a point when it comes to the importance of academic memorization versus creativity. American public schools have been drawing and redrawing that line trying to find the right balance to mold the leaders of tomorrow with mixed results. Yet when I hear stories of a fifteen year old inventing a new groundbreaking cancer test, I can't help but feel a little prideful of being the partial product of American schooling.But while the Chinese seem to be stumbling, India has really stepped up, or at least the film 3 Idiots (2009) would have you believe it. Starring Aamir Khan as the amiable Rancho, the plot of 3 Idiots sounds like a Van Wilder (2002) rip-off. The brilliant but unorthodox Rancho causes mayhem and silliness at an uptight engineering university. His two friends Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) join in the revelry to the dismay of the pig-headed dean known to the students as Virus (Boman Irani). But when Rancho takes interest in the dean's daughter played by Kareena Kapoor, the dean vows to have the 3 idiots expelled for good.Bollywood films are very good at taking seemingly trivial plots like the aforesaid and escalating them into gorgeous, high energy, thematically complex tales for which 3 Idiots is no exception. The movie encompasses a vastness of emotion and a breadth of themes which I do not dare expand on here for fear of ruining the movie. I will say that 3 Idiots does further validate my hypothesis that a major theme in modern Bollywood is upward mobility. While my familiarity with Indian film is limited, all the films I have seen made over the past twenty years involve a protagonist unhappy with his or her station in life and works their butt off to achieve better, often through creative means.I saw this theme in the repellently named Wedding Planners aka Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and the silly sci-fi comedy Joker (2012). Even the sappy love musicals of Yash Chopra like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) have characters who want to do better largely by questioning the conventions of traditional ways. 3 Idiots is an extension of that proud tradition only done with excellent comedy and some surprisingly depth along with some catchy musical numbers.Stop to consider today's modern American films in comparison. Sure there are classic hero journeys in movie theaters but few have unadulterated happy endings quite like Bollywood. Many settle for the moral of ""do what you can,"" or ""you can be happy with your lot in life so long as you have someone to love"". And let's not forget the common contemporary comedy message ""have fun and worry about the consequences later."" These messages make sense in the economic malaise of the day and the superhero genre has replaced the musical comedy as far as being a glitzy distraction for the masses. Still the superhero films as well as the Oscar-bait of the last few years don't have the subversive themes of their Indian counterparts. Nor to they have the energy! The energy in 3 Idiots is so incredibly infectious, if you're not smiling in the first five minutes you might need defibrillation. Seriously call a doctor, you're legally dead.Those who are worried about China's looming domination of Asia and eventual world power status need not worry about it. If I were worried about any country flexing its muscle it'd be India. It's a polyglot, multicultural nation with English its language of commerce. It's got a huge, pro-democratic population and has the creative juices to pull off long-term economic and cultural growth. But don't lose any sleep over the decline of the American Empire, at least our overlords will be benevolent or at the very least hilarious.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"
"Absolutely loved it.","14 July 2011","8","I checked this out on a whim from my library and was so impressed that I just had to come here to review it. Please note I am NOT Indian, but this is (as of yesterday) one of my top five favorite films of all time. My only criticism is the title - it's horribly misleading for American audiences who would probably expect a Judd Apatow nonsense film (and offensive to boot). Not so with this film - the characters are anything but idiots despite their college experiences. Brilliantly written and directed, there's something for everyone here: comedy, tragedy, and even a couple of song and dance numbers (seamlessly integrated). The acting is superb, the plot is a bit complex but fascinating, and it's shot with care and attention. LOVE IT."
"inspiration","8 September 2012",NA,"this movie has a lot of things to tell us ..it shows us the extremely huge power of the mind and when the people are free,use their minds correctly and do what they really love as a job in their lives and not what the other people say to them,only then they success,and most of all they are happy and they can live every time of their lives..a movie with so much fun and suspense,with so great direction gives a so inspired result,and everyone will be full of emotions and optimism..i really thought that bollywood was some kind of parody,but without so much fun,without good direction and a lot of things like these..i am really sorry for that but i couldn't know..i thought that they were extemporaneous...fortunately,that movie made me wrong..it showed me that the films from east have so much fantasy and inspiration that i could never imagine..you have to see it!!"
"An ""oeuvre d'art""","13 November 2011","10","For starters, every cinephile must watch this movie, it's absolutely mandatory!!!! The movie has great story line, rich in its roots, evolves naturally, showing beautiful landscapes of India. All characters are so dense, so real, so credible, despite of being caricatured....there is a lot of marvelous interactions between them all way down the story...and their interaction onto scenarios are great and constant...that's one thing I could notice it made the movie such a strong production.... The film is funny, genius, superb, surprising, fading from touching moments to challenging scenes, so naturally...... Reamrkable photography as well. It's one of the most exciting movies I've ever seen - is deep, enjoyable and, ultimately, leaves a lesson about what is really important in life.... I recommend the family watch this movies, together...is outrageous!!! It mention taboos, the everyday's strive of families, hopes, dreams, disappointing, love, envy, debauch, etc.... And all this magic moment, start with an aborted airplane take-off......"
"This movie is really meaningful to us Asians","26 October 2013","10","The very fact that the education system in my country (and perhaps in a lot of developing countries) SUCKS and as a student, I am seriously suffering from it, makes this movie worth watching. It gives me a little hope, a little faith, that success and happiness will eventually come to those who pursue excellence in stead of just focusing on their grades, their qualifications. I guess that many Western people cannot understand what Asian students like me are going through. We have to study all day, I mean, studying is not only a 7 to 5 ""job"" but it also deprive us of our sleep. The working environment is so damn competitive, our parents are like 'get straight A's or you will have nothing to eat' and the stress is unbearable. So, if you are having to deal with all these, give this movie a try! Good laughs, great messages, enjoyable story."
"Aal izz... aalmost perfect.","24 December 2009",NA,"Perfect. Almost. Oh yeah... those are the words! I'm writing this at the 8th hour of the morning of 25th December. Merry Christmas, viewers, this is the perfect treat. I was lucky enough to have caught a special preview of the year's best movie, 3 Idiots, last night. Aamir Khan fans, after a disastrous Ghajini, prepare to be truly delighted! He once again shows his 'perfectionist' attitude with this highly-anticipated soon-to-be blockbuster! It has EVERYTHING - from good humour, to emotions that actually move you. When a sense of fear is supposed to be created, it is created, and when you're supposed to feel good, you do! Remarkable performances by each and every one of the characters just adds to the entire effect. A nice-to-listen-to soundtrack assures you that even the song sequences aren't boring. And over that, such beautiful choreography! Witty dialogues and hilarious one-liners keep you wanting for more, and some head-bobbing suspense makes you wonder as well...But, above all, above EVERYTHING else, what truly, TRULY makes this movie work is Rajkumar Hirani's brilliant sense of direction. How he cuts between the past and the present, at the perfect moments, is just amazing. With this, he could finally emerge as one of the leading directors of the country today.3 Idiots is based on the book Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, even though it's hugely different. And, for the first time in my life, I can proudly say that yes, finally, a movie has not just done justice to the book, but easily surpassed it. All thanks to Rajkumar Hirani. And proudly too because an Indian did it! I have to be strict... it's an Aamir Khan movie. So I have no option but to cut off 1 for the editing and dubbing errors.9/10. What more do you want? Don't miss it for anything!"
"""Aal izz well"" with the 3 Idiots!","27 December 2009","10","Chetan Bhagat's ""Five Point Someone"" may not be called a literary masterpiece, but it sure is entertaining with its guffaws and its Indianized English. I read the book a while back, and I was highly impressed by the author's straightforward and vitriolic views about the sagacious education system. Bhagat had introduced Ryan Oberoi to play the role of the rebel, an anarchist who wanted to do away with the grumpy system of education prevailing in India. Ryan was never his protagonist; he simply played the second fiddle in the book. It was Hari, the mundane narrator of the book who was the hero. But things turned topsy-turvy when Bollywood walked into the scene to dramatize the already dramatic story of Five Point Someone. And then when in the book everything went happily ever after with the three idiots, namely Ryan, Hari, and Alok, Bollywood begot its own idiots Farhaan (R. Madhavan), Raju (Sharmaan Joshi) and Rancho (Aamir Khan)the great for its new cinematic endeavor 3 Idiots .3 Idiots can be summed up in one word as extremely majestic. It surely will make you laugh your guts out with its slapstick jokes, its funny sequences, its bathetically emotional scenes and make you to shed a tear or two in the emotional sequences. In short, 3 Idiots is a perfect desi dinner for your bulbous eyes which has all the spices in almost perfect proportion. The genetically modified melodrama has all it takes to hit the Indian audiences hard, and I see it topping the charts in no time. The movie definitely followed a major part of the book, only the incidents were either jumbled or heightened for greater effect.3 Idiot' is a laughter riot right from the first scene where Farhaan fakes a heart attack while onboard an Air India flight to the last scene where Chatur finds out that his role model Mr. Phunsuk Wangdu is none but his college rival Rancho. I especially loved the portrayal of Raju's glum family in black and white. Despite scenes of hilarity, 3 Idiots does suffer from backlogs of vague emotions which seem at some portions of the movie vaguely put on, unorganized and unneeded. Another thing that stuck me was the heroic character of Rancho. I know it doesn't look good for the perfect image of a movie if its hero fails to live up to the standard and flunks in exams or scores 5 point something, so Bollywood made Ryan Oberoi (of the book) alias Rancho become the class topper thus bringing forth the idea that we cannot still accept a flawed hero in our movies. In the long run, the act actually exemplified the character of Rancho and brought out the real essence of the movie. But the child delivery scene in the movie was definitely overtly exaggerated. I don't think Chetan Bhagat has ever imagined his Ryan to do a child delivery with the aid of his friends. Since everything is fair in Bollywood and war, such sacrileges add to the vivacity of the movie's plot.3 Idiots is a star studded affair which presents us with the grand acting skills of stars like Boman Irani as Professor.Viru Sahastrabuddhe or Omi Vaidya as Chatur Ramalingam. But Kareena Kapoor seemed a little unwanted as Pia, she didn't add to the character of the fashion designing student Neha of the book, instead she is here a smart would be doctor who falls for the charm of Rancho out of the blue. One thing that stuck me about the movie is the way the real ages of the stars have been camouflaged fruitlessly. Even though Aamir Khan is a perfectionist as an actor, he seemed a little too old to be an engineering student in his early twenties. Nevertheless, the movie is a first hand example of great filmatography and fabulous humor. Like all Rajkumar Hirani' movie, this one has treats for all its viewers. The peppy song ""Aal izz well"" reminds us of his Munna Bhai movies.The dialogues used in the movie will definitely come as eye openers to brainless muggers. 3 Idiots deftly bring out the very quintessence of Five Point Someone bringing to light the fatal flaws of the Indian education system. And though at some point Aamir Khan does look like a know-it-all holy spirit inculcating others with his words, he does reciprocate Chetan Bhagat's ideas that the Indian education system lacks creativity and spontaneous love for knowledge. I hope Aamir's words reach the generation next and come as a harbinger of a utopian vision of a new educational system in India. Movies with messages such as this one should be taken as ground breaking attempts to change society.The movie is an absolute delight when it comes to music. It features a galaxy of beautiful songs shot in great locations. I personally loved ""Behti hawa"" and ""Zoobie doobie"". Overall, 3 Idiots is a wonderfully heartwarming movie that teaches us to stop being mentally troglodytes and introduce creativity in our minds."

"A Bollywood for everybody","29 February 2016","7","Dear hypocrites: If ""Amelie"" and ""Forrest Gump"" can be mainstays of the top 250, so can ""3 Idiots"" - a movie that similarly gets away with a lot of silliness because it's truly endearing and has an unbeatable joie de vivre. It also features a genuinely uplifting message that only hardboiled cynics will fail to appreciate.Yes, it's probably 45 minutes too long, but on the flip side: the songs are fun, the directing is dynamic, and Aamir Khan pulls out his best Indian Tom Hanks performance. Also, unless you're xenophobic, it's fascinating to see love, dreams and life from an Indian perspective.If you want to see one Bollywood movie before you die, make it this one. It will make you feel better."
"Touching story of friendship, drama and adventure from Bollywood!","7 July 2014","7","I first watched this movie while on vacation, staying at my aunt and uncle's house. As this was the movie they chose to watch one night, I was preparing to drag myself to endure a painfully long, three-hour drama. However, I've found it to be very engaging and entertaining.In this film, Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi want to re-unite with college friend Rancho and recounted their college days at New Delhi's Imperial College of Engineering, recalling the memories of Rancho, who inspired them to think differently, their run-ins with the fiery college dean Viru Sahastrabudhe and their encounters with another student, Chatur Ramalingam, who reminds them of a bet they had made 10 years ago.This is the first and only Bollywood movie I have seen and while I am not a big fan of drama, Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijit Joshi wrote a very inspiring story for the film that kept me entertained, covering friendship, sacrifices, relationships, antics, secrets, rivalries and struggles in the movie. Hirani took good care making each scene of the movie captivating and intriguing while directing, keeping the plot's momentum going strong even for a three-hour movie, and assembled a likable cast of characters - each delivering solid performances.I enjoyed watching the antics and misadventures the three friends go through during their college days, fumbling through exam notes and cramming in science projects, striving to reach success. Rancho's little romantic relationship with Pia is also a treat to watch, ***minor spoiler ahead*** especially when, unbeknown-st to Rancho, that she is the daughter of the dean. ***minor spoiler ends*** The songs sung in the film is wonderful to listen to - very catchy and fun - and the cinematography is very vibrant and colorful.Overall, it is a very captivating and heartfelt film from start to finish, sure to bring you laughter and tears. You can't help but follow along and pretend you are there with the three friends' journey in life. A highly recommended movie! Grade A"
"The story deserved a better climax at the end.","9 January 2010",NA,"Definitely it's blast for the fans of Aamir Khan. Great story starts with perfect cast & acting. Then just move forward with a great pace & fantastic humor that everyone expects from any Rajkumar Hirani film. Moreover, the main content & message proves that surely it was another a very much needed film for the respected audience. And as usually Mr. RH delivered the package very well. But my only little disappointments goes with the final climax. The sequences of final climax are very much important to closing the main statement in a way that stays in the mind of the audience for an adequate amount of time. And that can then help to form a judgmental & thought provoking ideas. For example, MUNNA BHAI MBBS. The whole vacuum baby delivery idea may be new for the viewers with a little demonstration of usefulness of WEB CAM tech. Though I haven't get the chance to read the original novel but personally I think this climax sequence didn't quite fit in a proper way with the content of the story like the climax of MUNNA BHAI films were superbly coped with those stories. I think 3 Idiots deserved a better climax at the end rather than found them busy to have a successful delivery with the help of a vacuum machine. At least I didn't expect that coming. Other than that it was perfectly entertaining."
"Reality Check for you","10 January 2013","9","Being an Indian I have seen a lot of Bollywood movies which do not live upto international standards. 3 Idiots is no different. It's a masala movie, which will draw only mainstream and dumb folk. It might be attractive to the viewers outside as such experiences are new to them, however the truth is that this movie doesn't deserve any place in any top lists on IMDb. I'm sure that the people who have given it a 10/10 have never seen any other movie on the top 250 list. It was a major hit in Indian theatres and any rational,logical and a real movie buff can never like this sort of an impractical movie. To be honest, for an Indian movie I'd give it a 6/10 , however on an international scale it would barely get a 5. If you want to watch a good Indian movie, I'd recommend watching Dev.D which I rate as an 8/10; and I feel should be on the top 250 list. Make a wise decision"

"The magic of ACE KHAN AAMIR KHAN and Best director R.HIRANI","7 October 2015",NA,"What a fantastic movie.. it has everything in it.. Friendship,Love and a deep message of how to achieve your goals..

"Funny*25000000","2 December 2015","6","I have heard about the movie since its first release in China, but my friends always despise Bollywood movies because their style is not original. But 3 idiots is intriguing enough to shatter my bias. Character building is successful enough to make the three idiots, Pia, Virus and even Chatur seems authentic and attractive to me. I love the bright, joyful color of a school comedy that lightens up the mood before the characters even appears. Twists and turns in this movie is so cleverly arranged that the excitement they creates are perfectly maintained by the next. Rancho, the legendary guy, happens to leak his whereabouts when Chatur declares victory over the other 2 idiots, and they happen to seize the opportunity to make the real Rancho spill the shameful truth, and Pia happens to get married at the same day, so they can restore the poetic justice for Rancho/Wangdo and embrace the perfect ending. Along with the genius student character that challenge the virus and seniors and get away with it, the audience's expectation for this older Rancho climbs to the peak when the car reaches his school, so that the final enlightenment of his true identity push the satisfaction to a climax. The screenplay writer must be a genius.Actors for the the main roles are also outstanding. There lively expression break the leash of staid Indian faces in our perception. Also I was a little disappointed by the first appearance of Rancho, this extraordinary actor present the image of a genius student and a successful scientist. The one point that touches me the most is their tears, which cooperate with their sincere glittering eyes and pretty smiles. Every time when I am about to leap out of the drama because of the ""I will stay here until your dad gets well""cliché, I am pulled back by their facial expressions. Pia is beautiful and attractive all right, also I don't understand why she attempted to married the price tag after dumping him once. Is it really that important for a Indian woman to get married? Virus is ugly and ridiculous with his huge big belly, I started to like him after he offered Rancho his pen unwillingly after he saved his daughter. He was an ossified elitism asshole until I detected his unyielding love for Mona and his deceased son.After all, it's a brilliant piece. Love it, 8 stars"
"Unexpected","25 January 2016","6","Finding this movie and checking out the ratings, I was left a bit confused and wondering whether or not they came from all the Indians watching it. As it turns out, they didn't. This was an amazing movie, a movie that tackles more than one topics but focuses on the anxiety of young people studying, wondering what they are going to do with their lives. This is a global phenomenon and this is a great movie to watch early in your lifetime. I am not 20 or so, but it still taught me a thing or two and allowed me to objectively assess my situation in my work. I loved it. Humor is there in large doses, the scenery and landscapes are amazing and the movie is optimistic but also realistic at points. There are moments in the movie when you're laughing and in an instant you may find yourself crying. It was long but justified to be and it was never tiring, not at any point during the film. The actors were just brilliant and I think that this is one of the finest movies on Indian culture I have ever seen. If you also managed to miss it as I did, when it came out, now's the time to look for it and rent it. It's a must!"
"Quirky and overly-sentimental as hell, but all is Well!!","16 November 2021",NA,"I wasn't expecting much from 3 idiots other than a comedy on par with Animal House. But goddamn, what a movie!! This had SO many memorable scenes. I won't get into too many details but I've never seen a movie that ties up every single plot-line so smoothly. The ending could NOT have been more satisfying (or suspenseful); well worth the 2.5 hr runtime.Expect the rebellious attitude of Shawshank Redmption, the humor of Animal House and the quirkiness only Aamir Khan could concoct."
"GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE IN THE WORLD","10 July 2021","1","THIS MOVIE WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH,CRY,ANGRY & WILL INSPIRE YOU AT THE SAME TIME. RANCHO,RAJU & FARHAN IS THE BEST TRIO I'VE SEEN IN INDIAN CINEMA. EVERY DIALOGUE IN THE MOVIE WILL INSPIRE YOU & TEACH YOU SOMETHING. THE FUNNY SCENES TOO WILL TEACH YOU MANY THINGS. A PERFECTLY MADE MASTERPIECE. FOR ME IT IS AN EPITOME OF PERFECTION & BEAUTY. RAJKUMAR HIRANI'S PERSPECTIVE IS DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER DIRECTOR'S I'VE EVER SEEN. HE CAN MAKE YOU LAUGH,CRY & INSPIRE YOU AT THE SAME TIME. NO WORDS WILL BE ENOUGH TO TELL YOU HOW BEAUTIFUL A MOVIE IT IS. PLEASE WATCH IT ONCE BEFORE YOU DIE.(100/100)"
"3 Idoits! :)","2 April 2012","1","I thought I was going to see some Bollywood version of ""American Pie"" or something. But this is truly a fantastic, thoughtful, well-made film! But this film's title will mislead a lot of people thinking this is some mindless teen flick. I will do my best and recommend everyone I know to see it!Very nice songs in the film. Zoobi Doobi and All is well. Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Boman Irani are very successful. My favorite player in the serious Aamir Khan!My favorite player in the character Raju because he is a very intelligent person.Great movie! Definitely see it."
"Not original, nothing new.","8 February 2010",NA,"So Amir Khan made a new movie. Since Lagaan I have high expectations of the movies Amir makes, but he cannot keep up with the level he has put with Lagaan.Everything about this movie is annoying. The story is told by one of the idiots. A story telling movie in movies nowadays is not modern anymore. The stupid giggles like the narrator is telling a joke is not funny. Never laugh about your own joke. Every time the narrator talks, it's just like he thinks he's telling a joke very time.I did not know who in this movie were the idiots. Kareena Kapoor, because she wants to marry a donkey and an other idiot has to open her eyes? Omi Vaidya, because he's running his school for years (like in Mohabbatein) but he does not know how to educate children? What happened with Amir Khan's muscular body from Ghajini? Spoiler: Rancho (Amir Khan) ain't Rancho in real life. So Farhan and Hari want to look where Rancho is, but they find out Rancho is an other guy. They see a school photo, but instead of seeing Amir Khan on the photo, they see that other guy. This can't be, because Farhan and Hari were present on the day the photo was made and Amir Khan was on that photo, not the other Rancho. What were the movie makers thinking? That their audience are idiots too? The movie was too long. I fast forwarded most of the scenes. There were no good songs, so I forwarded every song also. In the beginning Omi Vaidya had a pen that he would give to a student who would be outstanding. From the beginning you know that he will give it to Amir Khan. What teacher lives with his family at school, that when his daughter has to give birth to a child, a student called Rancho has to do the delivery? Omi Vaidya plays a man who has two daughters. Amir Khan plays a student that has no child at all. It is not obvious that Amir Khan did the delivery.I do not understand why this movie gets an eight on IMDb. It wasn't that great. It has moments where the dialogs were interesting, like the father of one of the idiots did not give his son the laptop, but suggested to buy him a camera instead. But there were moments where the movie was awkward, like the speech what was made and raped by Rancho. Rancho was laughing his ass off when the stupid student recited the speech. Why? He rewrote the speech by himself...I have higher expectations when it gets to movies from Amir Khan. Oh brother where art thou? This movie was a mixture of ""Patch Adams"" and ""Dead Poets Society"". Bollywood movies in general are not original. Mostly they are copies of Hollywood movies. This one is not original either."
"A perfect move","5 June 2021","10","If I could give this movie 100 out of 10, I would do it."
"Very Funny And One Of The Best Comedies I Have Ever Seen !!","27 August 2013","10","First of all, This is the first time for me watching an Indian movie. This film isn't over rated at all. It's very entertaining and amusing. The whole cast was great every actor played his character very well specially (Boman Irani) and (Aamir Khan) for being 44 years old and performing a younger character with almost no changes in age. This movie is awesome not because of one actor or a couple of actors, it is a joint effort of every member of this movie. The director was good for assigning these actors to play those characters, and the music was good. This was my first time to watch an Indian movie and it's not going to be the last. I recommend it for those who love comedies and they will not be disappointed."
"3 Idiots (2009)","4 January 2012",NA,"I really tried to like this. And just to be fair, there are a few entertaining moments, it's professionally produced, and the performances for the most part aren't that bad. Heck, I'll even go so far as to say all the protagonists are pretty good. But good lord, what an awful script. Melodramatic clichés galore, terrible humor (why so many pee and fart jokes?), simplistic messages, a hero who can absolutely do no wrong and villains for whom the phrase ""one-dimensional"" is generous. It's as if someone marathoned through the absolute worst Hollywood has to offer and took notes. The sad scenes are laughable, the comic scenes are painful, and all of it is predictable (except the final little twist, which I admit was kind of a nifty surprise). Much of the film resembles REAL GENIUS, from the unflappable, infallible hero to the evil professor and the suck-up rival. And that's not a movie you want to aspire to. And there's a scene I know I've seen somewhere else before, but I can't place it. Teacher tells student his exam/paper won't be accepted because it's late, student asks if the teacher knows his name, teacher says no, student stuffs paper/exam in the middle of the stack. It'd be a clever bit, if not for this nagging feeling it was lifted from something else. Even the songs aren't that great, although the accompanying spectacle is sometimes charming. In the end, it's the three leads (Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and Madhavan) and the romantic interest (Kareena Kapoor) and their endearing performances despite the horrible material that save this from being a complete waste. But I certainly wouldn't recommend it."
"The True Gem of Bollywood. Even Hollywood can't replace it.","6 August 2021","10","If you want enjoy comedy, romance, friendship, social problem and its solution packed in one movie. Watch this Masterpiece.I watched this movie so many time but Everytime I see it, it becomes more and more enjoyable.Aamir Khan is perhaps the greatest gift of God to Bollywood who gave it some of the greatest masterpieces no one can't remake.Rajkumar Hirani's perfect direction, wonderful performances by Aamir Khan, Boman Irani and Kareena kapoor, and the final message of the movie makes it the 'GREATEST MOVIE OF THE CENTURY SO FAR'."
"Masterpiece from Bollywood","17 January 2023","10","Masterpiece from Bollywood, All is well, as they so often say. Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots, my introduction to the world of Bollywood cinema, is a comedy-drama unlike anyone I've ever seen, long, but never drawn out, frantic, but never desperate, and emotional, but never manipulating. It provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade, and with insight to the culture of Indians and their parents. Rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind, while possessing a title not even fit for a farce. 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief."
"A Movie I Can Watch Anytime","20 June 2021",NA,"I love films that draw me into the lives of the protagonists and subtly take me on a ride with them. To me, a good film makes me forget that where I am, what I am doing and who I am for that 2 hours or so. I cry and laugh with the characters. The actors on screen personify their characters and I cannot imagine them in any other role. 3 Idiots is one film that did exactly this.At College, they cross paths with various characters. The Dean of the College, Professor Viru ""Virus"" Sahastrabuddhe is an overachiever, having taught himself to write with both hands to save time, among other skills. He has his own idea of the perfect student and routinely patronizes students who do not meet his criteria. This comes down to most of the students at the College. Fellow student, Chatur ""Silencer"" Ramalingam, provides the comedic element of the film. Chatur is ambitious and believes that textbook memorization of engineering concepts is the way to success. He considers himself superior to others at the university, taking shortcuts to impress the Dean. His efforts often make him the butt of jokes and pranks among the trio, one of which earns him the nickname ""Silencer"". Of course, no film is complete without romance, and this is provided by the appearance of Pia, Professor's Viru's beautiful and intelligent daughter, with whom Rancho falls in love.In the middle of all these, they crash a wedding, deliver a baby on a makeshift operating table, settle a bet, fall in love and have hopes and dreams broken, all in Bollywood style. The film draws on themes of filial piety, obedience, friendship and the importance of following your heart. It also subtly hints that perhaps while we study, not all of us learn. The trio live, laugh and love with each other while discovering more about themselves. As usual, there is dancing, music, drama, a catchy phrase and soaring breath-taking scenery. The film ends with several twists and leaves you inspired to take a closer look at your life."
"Absolute Master","15 December 2021","8","Frstly Take a Bow HIRANI Ji.Everything is great in this movie , No Flaws through out the film. Entertaining and thought provoking at same time.Acting of amir khan, Boman , madhavan, Joshi and of other actors are top natch. Everybody nailed it.Direction wise , hirani is most humorous i have ever seen. He delivered what he wanted in picture perfect manner.Must Watch for every Educated Guy/."
"unforgettable, inspirational, a must watch","6 January 2015","8","The first time I watched this film it was a great surprise, because I've never liked Bollywood films and I didn't know what to expect. A friend of mine told me that it was her favorite film and that I should watch it..I'm glad that I've listened to her.This marvelous film is so good that you don't even notice the long duration of it. It has a little bit of everything and even the few musical parts of the movie fits perfectly.Directed with a perfect rhythm, this movie rebels against the actual educational system in which the more important is to pass tests but not really achieving new skills than really learns something that is going to be useful.Rancho, the main character of the film, is introduced to the audience as an idealist who defies the system not caring about the consequences, his one and only concern is study hard for learning and achieve new skills. An amazing character that should inspire who watches the film.Definitely this movie is not what it looks at first sight, it is a great, unforgettable and inspirational film that gets into the bottom of the heart."
"Classic of 2010","5 April 2011",NA,"December 2009 was a month of blockbusters starting with Paa,then Rocket Singh-Salesman of The Year,then Avatar 3D and last 3 Idiots. 3 Idiots is a masterpiece in the History of Bollywood Movies. Rajkumar Hirani deserves standing ovation for his work. The music is very good.Aal Izz Well topping. The cinematography is great.Performance wise-Even though everyone act well in their respective roles.It is Omi Vaidya who shines as Chatur Ramalingam.Remove him,3 Idiots would have ended up being dull.Watch his speech scene and its sure going to make you laugh.Aamir Khan is excellent as Phunsukh Wangdu.Sharman Joshi as Raju Rastogi is also good.Madhavan is amazing as Farhan Qureshi.Boman Irani is stupendous as Viru Sahsrabudhe aka VIRUS.Kareena Kapoor is okay.Overall 3 Idiots is Bollywood's masterpiece."
"Fantabulous Indian cinema - Slow to digest but overall great appeal","24 December 2009","9","Well, to start with, lemme clarify, I have a knack of bringing down bollywood cinema being a puritanical movie critic. And the only reason I still hold on to Indian Cinema is Aamir khan. His movies have been the cornerstone of generational behavior through the decades. Indians have experiences the best of reelistic emotions, vigor, love, comedy through the works of Aamir. He defines a supreme talent with an eye for every detail that could connect with the audience in the lightest and most deepest of senses. You will never know what hits you when you watch some of his best works.Moving forward, I went to see 3 idiots with the same expectations from an Aamir movie. Starting with the storyline, it was pretty well presented and starting was glitchy which was readily made up by Aamir's presence, which obviously was staged as such but does make a nice impact. His two sideburns namely Sharman and Maddy did a superb job in their own respective way and special mention to Maddy for his subtle way of bringing the best out of a sidekick role. Another special mention goes to a character names Chatur (dunno the real name) for adding superb comic zing to the movie. Gals were passé but were essential. Some of the scenes were long dragged and kinda unnecessary songs as such a repertoire of bollywood, nevertheless, weighing pros against cons which anyways outnumber the cons, I would like to assure the kind of essence movie brings out as a whole is meaningful and thematic in the most lighthearted and fun filled way.Some of the hilarious scenes were so funny that my friend mentioned it to be the best comic scene in Indians cinema. People might point it out as gross or amateurish but it does forms an essential part of college humor which still is gibberish and kindergarten grade compared to western comedies. Aamir does a fantastic job again maybe not that much as the role he portrays but as an overall feel he brings to any movie he forms a part of. Hirani does bring lot of experiences from his part ventures into this movie but they are well figured out and I must admit, he does belong to the best breed of directors in Indian cinema's current generation with the likes of Imtiaz Ali, Vishal Bhardwaj and Prakash jha, masters in their own genre.Overall movie does give you a fantastic feel as you walk out of the theater and is a perfect gift from Aamir to everyone for Christmas. A must watch for Indian cinema buffs and indeed figures as one of the best recent movies with no award winning stuff but just for the flow it controls the psyche of the audience and brings them through all simple emotions with laughter and grit.3.5/5"
"3 Idiots: Chetan Bhagat, Raju Hirani and Us","1 January 2010","9","3 Idiots 6/10Rating it more than that is an insult to other good movies.Warning: If u've read the book which it claims to be inspired of, u'll be highly disappointed. The movie is so much diff. than book.Angst: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I could not find a single line giving credits to Chetan Bhagat for the idea at least.Question: Remember Taare Zamin Par? Now take Ishan Awasti from it, make him older enough to get into a college and make Amir Khan play the character, what do u get?? We get Taare Zamin Part-2 or 3 Idiots.This movie is a mix of Munnabhai MBBS and Taare Zamin Par (Painting vs. Photography; as if there is only one creative work in this world). Even the dialogs sound similar to Taare Zamin Par. I ask, what is the point in shouting same issue over and over, what is the point in proving same point everyday.Let me tell u, 3-Idiots has nothing new to deliver. This movie wanted to be in Munnabhai league but failed miserably. It lacks the fine tuning, light hearted situational comedy with subtle strong points. It lacks all Raju Hirani/VC effects.Yes, there are a few good comic scenes (the lecture is good but just drags and after a moment I was getting irritated by over-using of the words ""balatkar"" and ""stan"")And what should I talk about the screenplay, bakwas and weak, even most Imran Hasmi/Harman Baweja movies have good integrated script than this.Acting: Sharman Joshi is mentionable, Amir did overact, yes, I say it, just watch the scene when the dean drags him from his office to a classroom he acts like something funny is going on, scratches his head, a very loose body language and not at all matching to what a student might feel if he is dragged through corridor by the dean of a very renowned college of India. Amir just fails to portray a student.I can go on and on about its stupid loopholes, but lets stop here. Last but not the least, u have to bear some good but misplaced songs throughout the movie.Reading this far one can tell I hated this movie, then why u may watch it? 1>U will get some good laughs in a few good scenes 2>A good but repetitive theme 3>A feel good effect 4>Amir's only movie in this year (for Amir fans)"
"Unique watching experience","24 June 2013",NA,"I watched this movie few weeks ago...without knowing this would end up being such a wonderful movie that would be remembered forever. Its about 3 friends journey through the past and present. This movies has been by FAR FAR FAR one of the best movies i ever laid eyes on. I even feel blessed to be able to have seen this movie. It had everything a movie fan wished for. It was highly entertaining, it inspired me so much, it gave me messages about life, it made me cry, it made me laugh. I didn't wanted the movie to end...it was like a book you didn't want to put down... Impressive dialogues between the actors, it had the audience going through out the movie until the very end, simply such a creative wonderful movie. Truly this movie touched my heart. Worth watching 100%"
"A different Indian Movie but a little dragged on","7 January 2010","9","I have a bunch of Indian and Pakistani friends and they were all going over the moon with this movie so I decided to watch it. There is one way to describe this movie and that is different.The story revolves around three engineering students who bond with each other. Rancho is a brilliant student who prefers to have fun and makes it his duty to help people in any way he can. Farhan is a student who loves photography and was forced to go to the top engineering school by his dad. Raju is a religious student from a poor family that tries to excel in the school. THroughout the movie, they have their little adventures and even a couple of surprises or two in the school they are studying in. While the movie is different from most Indian Movies, the movie is a little long and a little dragged on. While it is primarily a comedy movie and there are many jokes in the movie, most of them aren't that funny and there were some very babyish jokes (people pulling their pants down randomly and people talking to each other while on the toilets). Like most Hindi Movies, there were also some good songs, but one was a nonsensical song that sounded unusually similar to zipadee doo daa. Towards the end (last 45 minutes) the movie also became painfully predictable and did not match the explosive first hour that had me captivated. The message however was very well understood and very well put in the movie.Aamir Khan is an outstanding movie star and he shines in this movie and as I heard he also produced this movie, it greatly resembles his other movie, Taare Zameen Par, in which a kid that is dyslexic rises above the standard and traditional South Asian view that a child must learn a certain way. It parallels the moral of this story in which South Asian communities must broaden their views and be more flexible instead of forcing their children to becomes either doctors or engineers and to not put pressure on their children by asking high demands in education.Overall, its a movie to watch because of its message."

"Another Munnabhai...Nothing great.","9 January 2010","2","No...Its not Sholay or Lagaan or even Hum Aapke Hain Kaun or Gadar. No I am not comparing with them. After noticing lots of popularity I was also pulled into the hype. But was disappointed to see another movie like Munnabhai. Same College and Principal and hospital etc. Not fresh story at all. Lots of old jokes. Some sequences are absurd. 3 idiots can take a old patient to Hospital but cannot take a pregnant woman and applies their engineering knowledge to deliver a baby. They can gather the whole college but not a single girl to deliver a baby. Like I said...its a good bollywood masala movie but nothing great. I don't know why some people are surprised about Aaamir's acting as a college boy. His face is still boyish and suits these kind of roles. May I ask in which film he looked like a Man? Arshad Warsi could have done better job in this movie. Now the good things. There were some good dialogues and good acting from Sharman Joshi(Raju) and Omi Vaidya(Ramalingam). This movie is Chatur Ramalingam's. The producers are clever to market the movie like Ghazni and make their money. After few days we audiences will look back and think how they made fool of us. This movie is worth watching only in DVDs."
"Now that, is a movie! Enjoyable. Fun. Unique. Brilliant. Emotional.","6 November 2014","2","May I add to that, potentially life-changing!I would rate this movie somewhere between 9 and 10 , I wasn't sure which grade to give it, but 10 seems more appropriate.This movie actually , has many flaws. And I know I often watch a movie then rate it with a 5/10 , then rumble about it's flaws.. But, sometimes there is just something that you ""love"" and in it the flaws are minimized and overlooked. So it is with this movie for me. I love love love how inspiring it is. And how it can bring the emotions out of you. Make you connect and feel with the characters! This is simply amazing! Not many movies can do that. There are 2 or 3 scenes that I adore, and then there are others, flawed and all.. but still this movie is just special. A must watch. It starts a bit slow.. but you have to be patient. First half is good, second half is awesome! The cast in this movie is perfect! Amir, his friends, the teacher , the girl. Just perfect. And really the girl was an important role to cast and she is such a good choice! Looks wise at first you would think hmmm maybe not so much; but that girl has a spark that you will not find. I saw her in one other movie and so I knew what she could do, and surely as movie rolls along , she adds her sparkly personality and lifts the movie a notch higher. Aamir Khan has become my favorite Indian actor, and is perfect in this, and the professor is also such a good choice! Just wow! Why do I go on and on about the cast, because this cast made the movie what it is. It's not about how well you act, it's how well a role you are put into based on who you are. A super good movie! Different from Hollywood, very refreshing!Real rating: 9.35"
"A Very Enjoyable, Feel Good Film","2 July 2011",NA,"As someone who has never seen a Bollywood film, and doesn't care much for them, I was skeptical about 3 Idiots. But, I had heard good things and decided to give it a shot. Luckily for me, it is a very enjoyable film. At times laugh out loud funny, at others deadly serious, it's one of those rare films that doesn't break the mold, but still manages to be fantastic.The film is primarily about three students who attend the prestigious ICE engineering school. One student, Rancho, quickly makes a name for himself as the student who walks the other way and makes enemies of the schools head, Virus as he tries to enlighten his fellow students Raju and Farhan. While not familiar with Bollywood films, I am familiar with the genres staples, and they are here, including musical numbers, lots of melodrama, and lots of crying. Yes, there is cheese here, but it's a well done film. The characters are enjoyable and the story is wonderfully told. Behind it are issues that, while laid in an after school special kind of way, are very serious. Suicide is even covered here, and it is not handled in a comedic fashion. These issues are taken very seriously and it is the heart of the film. The acting is mostly responsible here for the success of this film, relying on the combined goofiness and drama of the three primaries. I can't say that the film isn't predictable, though there are several shocking moments. But, even with it's predictability, the cast is so charming that it's just something you can sit back and enjoy. I suppose I wasn't expecting much going in, and at a running time of almost 3 hrs. (something very a-typical for this kind of film), you might think you'd get worn down. But this is a very enjoyable film. Yes, it goes to some very silly places and even seems awkward at times, but by the end, you can't help but smile. Can say I am honestly pleased I took the journey."
"3 Idiots is one of the best!","30 January 2015","9","Im not a Hindi movie fan, in fact, this is my first time to watch Hindi movie. But this film is totally blowing my mind! Great story, good script writing, best performance of Aamir and also others actors / actress too. 2 Thumbs up for 3 Idiots! Its not simply just a comedy, but with something to think about for our own, and also bring along with touching moment! The positive message from this film will definitely hit the viewers. It shows how most of people are react at this present moment. Like, do we really do what we love and love what we are doing? If there's a fear, do we really take the risk and overcome it? If there's an opportunity, do we see it and hesitate about it? Well, sometimes the results is not that important, the process is the most concern and 3 idiots really taught us we should appreciate the relationship with parents, friends, the one we love & care! The cinematography is good, the songs & music are nice too! Rajkumar Hirani is brilliant director and script writer! Salute. Rajkumar Hirani is brilliant director and script writer! Salute."
"Amazing, inspiring and enchanting - one of best movies I have seen","1 October 2012","9","Talking about unexpected When you see the title of the movie and know that it was best grossing Bollywood film that went around the world as a hit all around – well, you expect something watered down, something for everyone. Maybe in some way it is for everyone, but by far this is not bad.The message is simple – follow your heart, follow your dream and All Izz Good (a little chant of main character – Rancho – used in stressful situations). In India engineering is a prestigious occupation where many Indian parents see as future for their sons. Story is set in Nr. 1 Imperial Engineering University where our 3 main characters – Farhan, Raju and Rancho - meet. Most students are there to blindly cram book, get best scores in exams, get good job and buy big houses and big cars. But Rancho is different – he loves engineering and does not like the school system, he tries to change it. Sounds familiar? Well it is. But this is story is special. It is about real friendship, real emotions and a person who is able to inspire people, shake their mechanical lives, and wake them up. (Oh, and it has Bollywood song-and-dance cuts too, a lot of fun). It is indeed very pleasant to watch.As usual I would like to ponder upon one of notions of the movie. We all in our lives are faced with important choices and struggle to answer dilemmas they give us. Who should we listen to when we choose most important things in our lives – the Tradition, our Parents and Grandparents, our God or Gods, our Friends, our Hearts or our Rational Mind? It is tough. Sometimes it seems to me it was easier in the times when you knew from childhood who you will be – a son of blacksmith will be a blacksmith, a son of tanner most probably will be a tanner (well, for girls even more easy – marriage – but that's another topic). In Hindu philosophy, in Bhagavad Gita, a similar question is discussed. A great hero Arjuna I faced with a dilemma – he has to fight the battle, as he is kshatriya, warrior cast, however in this case he would have to kill people he knows and loves. He consults his chariot driver - god Krishna. Krishna tries to persuade him to fulfill his duty, his dharma as kshatriya. It is better to be mediocre warrior if this is your dharma, than to be best cook in the world and go against it. A philosophy difficult to pursue in life, especially in modern world. I personally think that since industrial revolution and alienation of worker and his/her work (to borrow the term from Marx), there is no way to see the profession, a job in the same way as it used to be (like I mentioned – son of tanner is tanner, but it was not a ""job"" in nowadays meaning). Our jobs are almost a consumer choice, just usually more permanent one. You choose your career along with it comes the attached lifestyle (a doctors lifestyle is different from engineers, and it is not only about the money, it has much to do with the constructed image of the profession). So in ambiguity of modern world, what does constitute as dharma? Rancho says it is voice of your heart.The movie has a happy ending. And if it is not pretentious enough for some critics – well, eh I think some things need to have a happy ending.P.S. I wonder how many engineering students in India dropped out after seeing this movie"
"What a movie! Brilliant","29 December 2009",NA,"Unfortunately i can only give a 10 on IMDb otherwise this movie should Definitely get 11/ 10Plot Two idiots Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman) sets outs on a journey to find their lost friend and the 3rd idiot Rancho (Aamir).. As the journey starts off, their college life and old memories of their friendship, with a unique free-thinker Rancho who inspired them and changed their lives, are unfolded through flashbacks and followed with some twists and turns...My Views 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurises the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it... On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to ""Five Point Someone"", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...Both humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...Technically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualisations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...Coming to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...On the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer's liberty and the episode of Mona's delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that ""chase excellence and success will follow"".. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...So to sum up, Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009, perhaps the decade!... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...one of the best movies of the decade... a must watch!"
"It talks about faulty education system, unnecessary study pressure, wrong high expectation of parents, increasing materialism and ignorance of human values THE FUNNY WAY","1 January 2010","9","There are many people who find nothing useful in real working life which have been taught and studied with great pressure during their student life. There are many instances where students have taken last step as suicide when they can't handle the study pressure. There are people who have inner abilities and skill sets of some other field than the field in which they are currently working or say there are people who trying hard to establish themselves in the field according to their chosen career path but can not make the headway. Actually these kind of people might have realised that they have taken wrong path and that is because of parent's expectation, social status or may be because of peer pressure. There are people who are repenting after making career in the field in which they are not enjoying and have mindset that they would have been done better in some other field. There are parents with the mindset that some educational field are good and some are bad. This is may be because of status in the society, job market and money reward in the field. But by this way they are ignoring inner abilities of their child and take the part in spoiling their career. This is like curing the disease the wrong way by giving wrong drug. This way they are killing their real pleasure. There are girls and guys who repenting after getting married to a person who is so materialistic who running behind only money and has no value for human feelings. Finally this kind of marriage wont last longer and results in the divorce. The film is giving good message to all of above people with humour. Songs are also good and well placed in the movie.Over all it is another very good movie of Aamir khan."
"More than just a movie!!!!","25 December 2009","9","When I heard that Raju Hirani, Abhijat Joshi and Aamir khan were working on a project together, I expected something good. I was wrong, because 'good' is a gross understatement of a project as brilliant as '3 idiots'. Yes, I call it a project because surely it goes beyond the realms of just being a movie. I say so because this movie stirs a dormant chord in our hearts, a chord that was always there but never found voice at the right time. If in TZP Aamir Khan made you cry and understand, in 3 idiots he will make you laugh tears but make sure you get the point. I sincerely hope that this movie can bring about a social change that is urgently required in our country today. Yes, the story is loosely based on Chetan Bhagats novel but it's far from being a theatrical adaptation. It has a story which will keep you fairly intrigued, humor that you will love and a message that surely has a lot of depth. Three friends stuck in an engineering college where none of them like the way things are run. Only one of them, has the courage to take things into his own hands- that's your protagonist Aamir Khan. You'll like him from his first appearance on screen and end up loving him. In his 40's he looks supremely convincing as a cool dude in college with a kind heart. Throughout the journey,he manages to capture your hearts with a perfect combination of humor and heart. If in TZP we saw Aamir Khan the director, here we are privileged to see Aamir- the actor take centre stage. He is phenomenal in his role and leaves adjectives inadequate for his performance. Kareena, the daughter of the head of the college is his love interest. She does justice to her given screen space and surely gets a few hearts beating fast during ""Zoobi Doobi"". Moving on from the love angle to the larger picture. Contrary to what you have heard or might hear, this movie not only challenges the Indian Education System, it decisively rubbishes it on every front. More than that, it challenges us to question our way of learning, of questioning, of thinking. Here, Madhvan and Sharman Joshi deserve an ovation for being splendid throughout the film. The friendship you saw in Rang De Basanti among a larger group was easily matched if not bettered by Maddy, Sharman and Aamir. Boman Irani picks off from where he left in Munnabhai playing the comic bad guy of sorts to perfection. The direction is flawless in terms of plot, setting and casting as each character justifies his/her role to the hilt. Also credit to the director for a climax which is sure to catch you by surprise! If I was coerced to point out flaws in this movie, I would say that Aamir's fake name concept, continuity of the film(which is more than 10 yrs) was a shade unrealistic. Also, the music is good, but as I said earlier, good is an understatement for this film. The epicenter of this earthquake called 3idiots ( I call it earthquake because that's what it will causeat the box office!!) is ""Always do what you love!!"" All I can say is that the entire cast and crew of this project definitely love what they do because their work gives us ample proof. If you'v watched it, go watch it again, if u haven't then I don't know what you are waiting for!! Go watch it, enjoy it, feel it but most important understand it. My Rating:- 9/10"
"All izz very very well :)","6 October 2015",NA,"Raju Hirani comes back with a masterpiece and it has perfection written all over it. Nice story, nice narration, superb acting and great direction. I was hoping the movie wasn't a remake of the book and was glad to see that the basic characters and storyline were picked up and everything else was original. The actors were very believable in their roles - not for once did they look any older than students barely out of their teens and blended really well into their characters. The movie keeps you so into itself and had so much to offer that when interval came, I started wondering what could they come up with for the second half but they came back with something even better!The story is of 3 guys - Aamir Khan as Rancho, Sherman Joshi as Raju and R. Madhavan as Farhan going through their 4 years in an engineering college and beyond. All throughout the movie they were their characters and not actors. The movies is beautifully presented and is a laugh riot and has some very emotional moments. It all fits together and you can totally relate to the characters whether or not you went through those 4 years of engineering college like I did. The storytelling is brilliant and it doesn't have second which I found boring or felt like forwarding.Music is nice - not great but it fits with the movie. The movie also has a message about the education system in India and is very true.My vote : 10 !"
"All time favourite Movie Masterpiece","14 April 2021","9","What a Movie .. belive me this is the best movie in the world. The content level 🔥 Acting Amir Khan each & every one & Driector Raju Kumar Hirani just salute to you.. Emotional, Heart' touching story."
"Strangely enjoyable in it's own unique way","6 January 2021","9","Bollywood movies are an odd bunch, with their camp, colourful and cheesy style. 3 Idiots is arguably one of the better ones, despite being far too long and ridiculously corny. Fun storyline, decent performances and dripping in vivid colour."
"Its Munna Bhai all over again","30 December 2009",NA,"What can I say, when the whole world is pouring accolades on the movie. Going by the reviews I too ventured to the movie with the whole family. In return what we go was crude jokes, tasteless scenes, senseless situations. The climax aptly summarizes the misery.At the end we realized that they almost re-made Munna Bhai MBBS all over again. This time around they just replaced Doctors with Engineers, Medical college with Engg College & Munna Bhai with Rancho. However at least the former was a clean comedy.If you are still curious about the movie, leave your kids behind & go watch at your own risk"
"Rajkumar hirani is christopher nolan of india","30 July 2020","10","Aamir khan mr perfectionist & rajkumar hirani is god of screenplay writing this movie is pure masterpiece what a charector writing what well made written comedy with emotions is directly touches the heart
This line is very imp

"Didn't like the name","14 May 2010","10","I loved this movie, it was a very smart and enjoyable movie despite the length. I loved the characters specially Rancho, Pro Virus and Silencer. I am not a fan of music in movies but I loved the music in this movie. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the name: 3 idiots is not appropriate, it should have been ""Looking for Rancho"" or ""Al-its-wel"". Another thing was It doesn't explain much about why Rancho ran away from his friends and his love, it never explains why he couldn't express his love. You can sort of figure it out at the end of the movie, but is not that clear. Well despite all this it shows Hollywood that a movie can be funny and smart at the same time, and a college movie doesn't have to be about stupid humor, booze, bombshells and boobies."
"funny film","9 July 2013",NA,"this is film is the most funnest i have ever watched Cos it made me laugh all the way though the film.. it was so many funny moment that you will laugh u head of just like me.. but i don't like the head teacher cos he is really nasty and horrible Cos of him one of the student killed him self and to be honest i would give him a slap Cos he is really horrible to everyone including his daughters,i also cried when that student died cos poor him he worked really hard for his family and then all went to waste as killed him self. although this movie had some sad movement it also contains most of the funnest bits ever! i would say to people u should watch this film.. as its really funny and amazing."
"Now it's clear why this have such popularity","27 November 2015","10","I rarely watch this kind of movies. I mean ""real movie theater movies"". I usually watch low budget indie type mystery/scifi/horror movies, but this time I was looking some comedy to watch. And found this. And I'm very glad I did!Let's start with that fact this is comedy after all. It does this job very well. BUT, there is just A LOT more than that! This is clever, this is very, very emotional. Tears wasn't so far away to come for me. Really. I think I have never been so touched when watching a movie. And I'm not even very emotional person. (I think watching this alone with headphones contribute this fact.)Something also fascinates me about Indian culture also. I think the language is awesome! I have watched also the ""Slumdog Millionaire"" movie and must say that these are only two movies from India, which I have seen and jeez! Very good movies coming from Bollywood.All actor AMAZED me! Not to mention Aamir Khan definitely the most! What a talent. Of course, excellent directing was also very important! Such a clever screenplay. And I have also used to watch movies less than 2 hours but these three hours went in a flash when watching this.It's wonderful how this was actually comedy, but was also so instructive and emotional at same time. Loved it. Great work Aamir Khan and Rajkumar Hirani!"
"Fun!","25 November 2012","10","I love Chetan Bhagat's novels. I work with many engineers who immigrated to the US from India. Bhagat's novels (especially ""2 States"") help me appreciate the land they came from, that schooled them, and is still attached to their souls.Both ""Five Point Someone"" and ""3 Idiots"" tell about students suffering through college and the transformation to adulthood. Both stories are engaging, cleverly constructed and funny as hell, but they show different things, at a different pace. Novels show internal transformation, while movies show the transformation of relationships. Neither story is biographical. Neither story depicts ""reality"". Both stories work as fiction and frivolous entertainment. Both are respectful of their characters.If you want great art, read Tolstoy. To learn How Things Work, read Darwin. If you like the Marx Brothers, and you want to laugh your ass off, watch ""3 Idiots"". This is not a movie to make you think (Of COURSE universities in developing countries are lethally competitive) but to bombard you with the unexpected. Which for this westerner included the jarring Bollywood ""let's stop the plot and dance"", though in this case it is ""let's use dance to fire-hose a different set of sight gags at the viewers"". One part of your laughing brain can rest while another takes over. This movie will definitely engage all your humor muscles, including engineer and college nostalgia humor muscles if you have them. If you enjoy ""funny machines"", there are plenty of those, too.Some parts were beyond me - Silencer's idiosyncratic Hindi becomes mere word-substitution jokes in subtitle, and I'm left to imagine how his non-standard pronunciation and mannerisms are 2/3 of the humor Still, even Silencer and Virus were treated with respect - all the characters were victims of a situation created by colonialism, poverty, desperation, and ambition displacing love. You can cry or you can laugh - choose your movies accordingly. If you want to cry about abused students, watch ""Dark Matter"" (2007). If you don't like fart jokes, don't watch this movie, or read Benjamin Franklin, either.India turns out a lot of films. I'm sure all the elements of this movie are borrowed from others, and if you've watched a thousand movies you won't see much new stuff here. Good artists plagiarize, great artists steal, and these artists robbed the entire film vault. They pasted their swag together pretty well, and in some surprising (to me) ways.IMHO, a 170 minute movie is too long, which is why I give it a 9. But if they edited it down to 90 minutes, and kept all the best humor, I might have died laughing. It was never plodding, though it slowed from manic to almost sane in places.I'm buying 4 copies for Christmas presents - I have some godchildren that need their humor centers stretched. This ought to do it."
"It will touch your heart and it will change the way you behave to people you love!","27 April 2014",NA,"Great movie, is my first time i watched a Bollywood movie and i was very satisfied!!Very good acting from all... That film was the first in my life that could change my emotions from one scene to other! You can laugh and cry at the same time. I 've never got bored during the movie, instead of that i was begging not to end and to have more and more story. The dialogs were very smart with a good sense of humor.It can teach you many things!Enjoy it!!"
"3 idiots","3 June 2014","9","I can say this film the best movie. I love the film. There are comedy, drama, love everything in this film. The film is educative, tutorial, fluent and entertaining. While I was watching the film, I enjoyed. The is criticizing the education system of the India because the education system is teaching memorization and competition but Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad is finding wrong to the education system. Three friends are studying the best school of the India in ICE: Raju Rastogi, Farhan Qureshi and Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad. Raju wants business owner because for the maintain his home , buy his father's medications and her sister's marriage. Farhan is going to the best engineering school of the India in ICE because his father wants but Farhan loves photography and Farhan wants to be a photographer. Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad is very different character. There is a school manager . School manager is evil- minded, hard, snappish. There is a manager's daughter. Manager's daughter is beautiful, optimistic a girl. Ranco is giving direction to the lives of everyone. Follow strictly the film. The film is very beautiful."
"my take: at the least, you can't say you don't get a full-course meal of movies in one LARGE one","29 February 2016","9","Unlike many who have commented here in the years since 3 Idiots was released in India and throughout the world, I am not well-versed with Bollywood movies - indeed, far as I can tell from his filmography, this may be my first Aamir Khan movie - so my take on this experience may be different from others. It's not even that I can't get into a cinematic whirlwind like this, as other filmmakers in other countries will (sometimes) go for BIG emotions and BIG turns like this one does (Love Exposure was something that came to mind during this, of all things). So if you read what I'm about to say and think I'm full of it or don't know what I'm talking about it, well, the latter may be about right, but I can still share my honest thoughts much as they are. And, as far as the most general impression, overall, this isn't too bad. Is it very good though, or as bad as certain IMDb message board posters might say since its ascension to the top 250 films of all time? In short, 3 Idiots is a full course meal of a movie, and it has so many types and moods of movie stuffed into one, like a Turducken or something: it's a broad college comedy, an Alvin and the Chipmunks farce (think about it, with Khan's Rancho as Alvin and the other two idiots variations of Simon and Theodore, sort of, plus the Chatur character as the 4th wheel), a soap opera about strict fathers and their children, a tragic tale about suicide meant to highlight a very real problem in Indian society, and of course for Bollywood a musical, not to mention a kind of moral story of what it means to be a teacher or a student and how to not be so uptight (another subtitle for this movie could be ""The System, They Just Don't Understand!"").It's even other things I'm sure, and the tones fluctuate and alter on a dime from one to the next. Case in point, there's a little more than mid-way through the film a very serious turn in the plot; nevermind how exactly it gets there, suffice it to say it's due to some late-night antics from Rancho with pals Raju and Farhan, with Raju most drunk the next morning in class and being forced to decide whether to be expelled or put it all on Rancho. Raju decides to jump out the window, though he doesn't die and he subsequently gets rushed to the hospital. Cue up the sad but (it can't be anything else) supremely heart-felt song that plays over as he is brought to stable condition. Then it becomes a rather crazy comedy of 'how do we wake up Raju' sequence as he is stuck in his, uh, comatose-sort of state and Rancho keeps saying wilder and wackier things to get Raju to wake up. And yet as broad as this is it's still serious... sort of.A lot of this happens throughout 3 Idiots; for a stretch of time the movie will take on something like a frat-house comedy (that's actually how the film seems like it will take shape early on, ""initiation"" sequence with butt-branding included!) but then it's (duh) also a romance with the headmaster/principal's daughter, Pia (Kapoor, pretty but also a very good actress) and Rancho since he not only is the cool/suave prankster but he also spots the phonies who try to have her hand as a significant other. But then it's also about Raju's sad (in black and white no less!) home life, and then it's also about how to function properly in an academic environment with Rancho sometimes like a, uh, RP McMurphy in Cuckoo's Nest turning the system upside down with the headmaster as the one-note headmaster. And then it gets into a musical number about things like ""All is Well"", which gets finished off by someone jumping off a ledge and to their death, which makes it uh... sad again, as it cuts to the pouring rain at a funeral.This may be de rigeur for those who are regulars for Bollywood cinema - for me, it was at times a startling experience, sometimes akin to getting whiplash on a roller-coaster. This is not to say it made the experience intolerable, however. It was surely made as a prestige/high-mainstream comedy/drama/musical-et-al, and it's the kind of movie that will have high-powered, super-slick musical set pieces (not quite as many as I expected, to be fair, and those that are here do stand out well and are the highlights of the movie aside from Khan's performance), and then for the regular musical score it will be some of the goofiest notes I've ever heard outside of a Disney channel show. And for as BIG as the actors go for this material - perhaps, you could argue, they don't have much of a choice - there are moments where there's something close to not subtlety but measured stuff; when Raju confronts his parents with what he actually wants to do with his life, it's a legitimately strong dramatic scene that pulls on the heartstrings just enough.In other words, it's probably not what will be the *best* Bollywood movie - some may put it high up there, and that's their prerogative - but if you are new to this style of movie-making (and I don't mean Slumdog Millionaire for the laymans that's basically Bollywood crossed with Danny Boyle), it's a good place to start. It's sometimes quite funny, and sometimes quite harrowing with its drama, and often it's much too much with the emotional manipulation (that delivery scene, my God). It is what it is."
"Amazing movie","15 April 2014",NA,"I have to admit, I didn't expect much. I tend to shy away from foreign movies and the title didn't seem very intriguing either. The trailer looked silly and I didn't really have a reason to watch this other than the fact that it was highly rated. But man was I wrong about this movie. When I decided to start watching it, I had little to no patience and was looking for the first reason to just stop watching it. As the movie progressed, I couldn't stop watching it! It sucked me into a world of comedy, romance, and drama in a way I've never seen used before. It was so unique in the way it was used; it wasn't a typical Hollywood film with every cliché scene being used. I quickly found myself become attached to these ""3 idiots"" through great acting and character development. This movie was stuffed with life lessons and ultimately very enlightening. It was all a slam dunk. a 10 out of 10. However, don't get me wrong. This movie wasn't perfect. There was a few scenes where they would break out into song for about 10 minutes which was a little annoying but I could see how it fit into the movie. I just sorta thought it was a bit childish and a little abrupt. But all in all, a very well developed movie. I highly recommend this."
"An average movie which still is better than most of the comedies which rolled out this year in Bollywood (Yes, that's the sorry state of Bollywood these days!).","1 January 2010","7","Chetan Bhagat's novel on which it is loosely based, is not a literary masterpiece but it succeeds in selling what it promises. I think a more serious, drama with subtle humor approach should have been used to make a good movie out of that novel. What we have got in 3 Idiots is another addition to the streak of mindless comedies. One movie genre which has suffered the most in recent years is comedy and movies like 'Jane bhi do yaron' or even 'Andaz apna apna' or many of the Hrishikesh Mukherjee's movies are not made anymore. What we get these days is run of the mill gags with jokes copied from youtube (Search 'funny student at exam hall' if you want to see an example).Rajkumar Hirani has tried to emulate the success of Munnabhai films by using the same formula but has tried to pull one too many a stunt this time. Munnabhai movies were fresh, something new always works! Repeating same thing over and over is what killed 3 Idiots. Amir tries hard and gets away with it but definitely younger actors could have done a better justice. Madhavan as an actor and narrator fails big time in this movie. An actor like Sharman Joshi who has done quite decent job till now in comedies isn't given much meat in his role. In fact I would have loved to see him do the role of Rancho! Boman Irani's character is straight out of a cartoon book and its not funny at all. Surprisingly, Kareena Kapoor has done a very good job in the smaller than others role she got. It seems she succeeds in carrying this role forward from Jab We Met!Finally, I would say that this movie has soul, it has a message(in fact may be one too many ;) but it lacks execution. It fails to stick to this message with heart because of senseless and unbelievable comic scenes which are forcefully thrusted to get some quick laughs but ultimately prove to be roadblocks in the storyline. Many situations in the movie are so hard to believe that you can only gulp them down if the movie was a spoof which it is not. I have seen(and have been a part of) much crazier things when I was in engineering college but still what they show here is simply stupid.Watch this movie if you want to relax and watch some mindless comedy where you have to apply your brain... 6/10 for me."
"Absolute rubbish.","27 December 2009","7","Pardon my ignorance.When an actor of Aamir's calibre decides to act in a movie after a year from his previous release, and when you have a massive production house backing your movie with a director whose had two back to back hits, You tend to expect a lot from a movie.But instead what you get is 3 hours of absolute rubbish.The facts are simple. Add a Lil bit of humour to a pathetic story and publicise it well and let the cash registers ring, because its the year end and there a billion fans of Aamir, who have been waiting so impatiently for his next movie for over a year, so anything he signs is bound to be an instant hit. And that has been the case for most of his movies for the past decade. Even MANGAL PANDAY cashed in a lot in the first week. What mystifies me more is the way Aamir went about publicising this movie? I am still confused and a bit dazzled as to what was the link between the story of the movie and Aamir touring India as your everyday people.What mystifies me even more as to what made choose him this movie. There was nothing even close to what you would call challenging in this film, considering his previous performances.Lets start with his character Rancho, a college student . Lets be honest, he has played that in so many movies that he could now do that in his sleep. A free thinker who studies and preaches education by his own rules and practicality. Funny why does Patch Adams just keep springing to my mind. The only difference being Robin Williams and Rancho was that Robin was practising medicine in that movie and Rancho is practising engineering. There were many one-liners that i heard giggles in the theatre, but not many of them realise that they are so 2 thousand late.Like for instance the NASA pen scene or even the best gag of the film the Omi speech are lifted from either stand-ups or foreign movies.It was like watching a blend of Patch Adams, Rang De Basanti,Patch Adams, Munnabhai (the first one because that too was inspired by Patch Adams), Patch Adams & Taare Zameen Par together.And it was Shambolic mixture to be honest. Even the English song "" give me some sunshine"" is inspired by an old Hindi ghazal. And i am really annoyed that nobody else realised that. Probably because the language has changed. So i will have to spell it out to you, compare the lyrics of this song and a timeless classic by jagjit singh, ""Woh Kaagaz Ki Kashti"", and u will begin to realise, that every bit of this movie is either inspired or lifted from one or the other, in the same manner Ghajini was inspired from a certain Christopher Nolan film.Yes i did find something that i liked in the movie, and that is only one shot from the entire movie, although very predictable, but the scene in which joy is shown hanging to his ceiling fan was a brilliant piece of direction. Its the way that it was shot in that amazed me.With Lage raho , Hirani stamped his mark of brilliance in many ways. As a director, a story writer and a story teller. It was refreshing and unpredictable. Even the first of the Munnabhai series had plenty of laughs and frowns although that too was mostly an indianised version of Patch Adams. Mr, Hirani, move over the patch Adams hangover now. Its high time. I am sure you might find many other movies in Hollywood, that still haven't been indianised.And once again pardon my ignorance."
"It's a movie","18 January 2010",NA,"Yes - it is a bit long. Yes - It is a bit unbelievable. Yes - it has old jokes. But the point is, it is a movie, not a documentary on global warming where the facts are supposed to be facts (really?) What I liked? The pace of the movie (assuming you remove some scenes like that baby delivery or bride kidnapping). The jokes are effective because they are well executed, acted, and the timing is just right. So are the melodramatic scenes. The acting is fine. Was impressed by Sharman Joshi. Aamir Khan (a bit old for the role) has always delivered. Omi has portrayed his character well.A few points. The plane scene is not a realistic one (then neither is Rambo or Air Force One). And, in this day and age, how can you not locate a rich guy who is making half a million dollar a month in small town India! The whole inverter idea with the baby delivery scene! Wow! The climax was a feel-gooder, but not appropriate as the message got lost. Boman Irani should have been a part of the climax and should have learned his lesson then.Oh, well. It is just a movie. When you compare it to other Holly and Bolly movies (which have similar flaws), this one does stand out as a good entertainer. Definitely worth seeing, I would say.."
"""Chase Excellence, Success Will Follow""","7 March 2013","10","An ordinary school story? Absolutely not. 3 Idiots ,in my opinion,the most exciting and different school-themed film of all-time.

"Best Bollywood movie I've ever watched","4 September 2010","10","One thing that comes to our mind when we say Bollywood is fancy stories with dream worlds. They are far for reality and almost nothing to take from it. But this movie stands still as a giant proving that Bollywood isn't all about synthetic dream worlds. This is a classic masterpiece with the combination of geniuses.Aamir khan my favorite actor in Bollywood shows here, he not just another actor but a man of wisdom. There are high class Bollywood celebrities, acting in very cheap movies even jeopardizing their well built reputation. One thing I notice on Aamir Khan is that he is not after each and every role only seek for the excellence. As he becomes successful with his career, he improves the way of thinking too. This maturity can be clearly visible in his productions too. (He could be the only Bollywood celebrity with a brain :)The plot of this movie is quite interesting and never get bored. Humor, Joy, Sorrow , feeling and everything is there. The specialty that tied my attention to this movie is the Dialogs. They are really a work of a genius. Rancho's dialogs as a college student perfectly call into our wisdom. They contains the thoughts of a philosopher. The message given by the movie is astonishing by the end. if it's summarized, ""Don't follow the success, only the excellence. Then success will follow you""This could be the movie that would change my life one day."
"A Modern Day Classic!","30 April 2012","10","First he taught us that laughter is the best medicine. With his second venture, he taught us the ways of piece and love through Ghandism. Now, with 3 Idiots, Rajkumar Hirani tells us to chase excellence and success will follow.I'm a viewer who believes the best way to send a message is through an entertaining way rather than a preachy way. A message through entertainment hits you harder than a boring and preachy one. Films, of course, are not meant to send messages, but it's always nice to see one that does. I honestly believe nobody can do it better than Raju Hirani - Currently the best director of Hindi Cinema.Like his previous attempts, Raju Hirani makes us laugh, cry and think all in one viewing. 3 Idiots not only introduces you to a new world, but also provides a fresh way of filmmaking and narration. Not to forget that it tackles an issue that not many have touched upon - The Education System.Years after graduating from college, Farhan and Raju receive a message from an old classmate, Chatur. Chatur claims that he has found their old buddy Rancho. Rancho, a free mind, an intelligent student, a good guy. Why is Rancho so important? What exactly did Rancho do? Why did he leave? Will Farhan and Raju find him? All that is depicted in the next nearly 3 hours of the movie.To start, 3 Idiots deals with a few things here and there. Whether it is the poor school system that discriminates and pressures you involving your grades. Whether it's you father forcing you to become an engineer and not allowing you to pursue your dreams. Or even a bright student who fears he may not be able to live up to the high expectations. Finally, 3 Ididots says one simple thing - Chase your dreams, demolish your fears and try your best - Success is a given.There are a number of significant moments I totally love in the movie. Aamir's introduction itself is a great start. I'll go on and say another lovely scene is when Farhan and Raju come last and find out where Rancho placed. Of Course, who can forget Chatur's hilarious ""Balatkaar speech"" Just Genius writing. There are more moments to cherish here. The whole climax is lovely. Mona Singh's baby delivery is gripping. Finally, Rancho's real identify being shown keeps you glued and enlightened all at once.My favorite part of the film is when Farhan and Raju decide their fates. Farhan confronting his father about his real dreams and Raju's interview - Just amazing moments.Flaws? I really don't see any. I do want to note that the film is almost 3 hours yet you do not feel like it has been that long.Rajkumar Hirani and his co writer really developed a nearly flawless script here. The lines are just amazing. They are fresh and also have that feel-goodness to them. The screenplay is excellent.The music of the movie grows on you. All Izz Well lifts your spirit. Give Me Some Sunshine is amazing. Behti Hawa is also an underrated song. Songs are pictured well.R. Madhavan gives his best performance in my opinion. His voice over is also a master stroke. He's got a strange innocence to him him this film. It works. Sharman Joshi is no less. He's just first rate. Especially in the scene when he goes to give his interview.Kareena Kapoor is actually acting well here. A great act. Boman Irani is first rate as always. He's just brilliant. His character is sort of similar to his earlier character in Raju Hirani's first film, Munnabhai MBBS. However, there's a huge distinction in Boman's act. Shows the man's versatility.Aamir Khan holds 3 Idiots together all through. I feel he should have gotten the best actor award that year instead of Amitabh Bachchan in Paa (That was a great act too) He looks the role, he's just perfect in every frame. You don't really expect anything less than that from Mr. Khan.All said and done, even Aamir would agree with me that the real hero of this film is Raj Kumar Hirani, the director. He's filled the movie with so many wonderful moments, extracted some memorable performances and has given one of the most entertaining films to Indian Cinema.What else can I say? Just a big thanks to director Raj Kumar Hirani, producer Vinod Chopra and actor Aamir Khan for giving us this modern day classic.In Munnabhi MBBS - It was a ""jadho ki jhappi"" In Lage Raho Munnabhai - It was ""Get well soon, mamu"" And now, it's - ALL IZZ WELL!"
"Best Adaptation of ""Five Point Someone"" by Chetan Bhagat","3 January 2010",NA,"I had read the book by Chetan Bhagat - Five Point Someone and I can say the movie really has done great honors to the book by bringing those characters to life with depicting those incidents. I enjoyed every moment of the movie brilliantly played by Amir, Madhavan and Sharman and off course Boman. There were moments when my wife would just hold my hand and look at me with tears rolling down her eyes. The movie is a must watch for everyone young or old. Hats off to Rajkumar Hirani for the best adaptation of the movie and last but not the least to Chetan Bhagat for creating such a master piece which Hirani has brought to the entire world. Go out folks and watch this fun extravaganza!! 10 on 10 for this masterpiece."
"What an amazing movie","16 July 2014","9","This is the first movie that I want to watch AGAIN Bollywood is simply brilliant.10/10 for ""3 idiots"".Although this movie was old,but it still gold.I would like to watch this type of movie rather than watching some recently filmsFrom the actor,the story,effect and soundtrack,everything is almost perfect Furthermore,the movie inspire me to pursuit my favorite jobAnd I bet you will find the same thing after you watch ""3 idiots""""Pursue excellence, and success will follow, pants down."" Such a wonderful quote"
"3 idiots","19 January 2022","9","Oh, and I haven't watched Indian movies for a long time! The last movie I remember is the famous ""Zita and Gita"", which I watched with my parents as a child.Having accidentally watched the film ""Three Idiots"" by an Indian film company yesterday, I was surprised to find that the films have been updated since then.The film tells about three friends who study at the university and face boring idiots teachers, idiots students, idiots rich. The title of the film may mistakenly form an image of three vulgar morons in my head, as in the movie ""Dumb and Dumber"". In fact, the film is about three good, kind, intelligent and inquisitive guys who are not afraid to speak out against the system, are not afraid to say what they think. They are called idiots by primitive teachers and a boring director. I'm."
"A good entertainer but over-hyped as usual","27 January 2010",NA,"Now a days people have the tendency to overreact to some good movies. Like in the case of Dark Knight, which was a good movie but not the immortal classic. Same thing goes here, this one is a good movie, sometimes u see movies to relax yourself. This is a good entertainer.But for a movie to become a classic or the top 250 of all time as some people say, u got to have something which you won't forget for the rest of your life. But 3 idiots lacked such substance. The movie's theme is good. The educational system of India is rotten. I perfectly agree to it. Even more the perspective of the common man to their children's education is pathetic, in my eyes. The movie really conveyed that idea. But let me ask you a question. Didn't Aamir Khan act in a movie called Taare Zameen Par, which sort of conveyed the same idea. That movie was good. It had heart. 3 Idiots is old wine in new bottle. The wine still tastes good.You can buy it, no problem. But don't b fooled. Don't think its new imported wine. Its still the old one.If only the director was a little bit more realistic, I think I would have liked the movie much better. He might say that lot of people liked the movie, but its going to be short lived. He could have made the movie a classic. All was there, script and direction was good, but not up to the mark"
"3 Idiots definitely tries to do things differently ... to certain extent successfully!","2 November 2011","10","I generally avoid commercial Hindi films but I watched 3 Idiots because I was told that it does things differently. For the most part, I found that to be true.Story: While the theme of the story is quite valid it's hard not to notice that it was discussed by a very similar Hindi film starring Aarmir Khan recently (Taare Zameen Par). In both films Aarmir Khan plays a similar stand out role which create a continuous sense of déjà-vu. The main story line of 3 Idiots oscillates between being simple, heart-warming and humorous to outrageous and silly. This makes things pretty awkward. One moment you would be engrossed watching a story of two troubled students being helped by benignant idealist and the next moment the idealist starts acting like Jesus himself with infinite wisdom. The story never hits a good balance. Personally, wise cracking Aarmir Khan's character got under my nerves far too often.Acting: Acting for the most part was quite solid with the exception Kareena Kapoor. Either all Hindi film directors want her to act the same role in every film or she has been copy/pasted from another film. Most scenes involving her were predictable resulting all attempts at humor to fall flat. Direction/Editing etc: The film is pretty long which made me feel that editing was not great. There were a few scenes that were quite irrelevant and overdone. But 3 Idiots packed enough comedy and charming sketches to keep me interested until the end. The characters are skewed so much to black/white and right/wrong; the film gave me the sensation that the director wants me to enjoy the film in one particular way. There was very little to think about after watching. Visuals: Most of the scenery and visual elements used to drive the story along was quite good and well thought out.All in all, 3 Idiots is enjoyable and there are lot of things to like. It's still aimed at the core Hindi film fans but it's accessible enough for others too."
"Bland and Boring......","2 January 2010","10","It is only if I had not lost my movie sensibility, I would have been placed better. The best part about India is that everything has a following and Aamir Khan with his histrionics and verbal spats is in the midst of a great purple patch. Everything he is touching is turning into gold and it takes a modern day genius to do that. He is more like a good salesman then an actor. If you can sell the same college song after 21 years, you sure have to be awarded the best salesman in your industry. Well, the real disappointment is not Aamir, as he frequently makes bad movies...Fana and Ghajini to name just the latest 2 but he also carves out little gems like Taare Zameen Par every now and then. And the disappointment is also not from the fact that he is still playing the college Romeo. The disappointment is with Raj Kumar Hirani who in trying to accommodate Aamir's star power did what Shubhash Ghai did in Yaadein. The Box office verdict has been starkly different for both the movies because young India connects to the message of 3 idiots well. Critics with a few exceptions did not speak their mind because they knew that this movie was going to do colossal business. But the fact remains a fact....the ending was manufactured and seriously pretending. It was like that the script writer was superficially trying to make everybody smile while walking out. It is the first time Hirani has erred and hope that he does not slip again, as he has given 2 most memorable movies in recent memory. This does not even come close. The point of view was excellent, the treatment not."
"Different Great Movie","6 December 2010",NA,"When I was looking for a movie, I reviewed here at IMDb for 3 Idiots. I was surprised to see that it was so popular. I now understand. The movie takes you in a ride of different feelings. It starts maybe as a common University comedy, but soon reveals to be much more.The whole educating system is put under question, behind what is a maybe not so reasonable argument, cause even if there are loads of people that are GREAT for their profession and don't get GREAT grades, the system evaluates only how a person adapts to a standard system to measure knowledge. All the same we can see a very different culture and values. Even in religion.The movie is all the time mixing deep feelings and thoughts, with a laugh and a joke. The songs also give the movie a pleasant touch.All in all, a movie to watch with A LOT of time, but a great movie to see, even with children to give them something to think about."
"One of the best movies of the decade. Don't be an Idiot and skip this movie!","24 December 2009","10","Absolutely brilliant one. Decent humor, equally includes love and emotions. Very nice performances by Aamir Khan, R Madhavan, Sharman Joshi and Boman Irani. Kareena looks good but would get a 3 out of 5 for acting. The film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high- pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference. So, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non- conformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.This would easily get a 9.5 out of 10. Don't be an idiot and skip this movie!"
"Wonderfully Entertainment","2 July 2014","10","It's hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.Like so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since ""3 Idiots"" is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films."
"great movie","14 August 2013",NA,"Despite these foibles, '3 Idiots' makes for an enjoyable watch, thanks to the bonhomie cracked up on screen by Aamir, Madhavan and Sharman. Aamir's Rancho is a bouncy, fidgety genius with a golden heart. The 44-year-old actor almost passes off as a 22-year-old collegian, bringing out in his character the juvenile buoyancy and vivacity few actors of his age can. Madhavan and Sharman give ample support from the flanks, but a word of praise needs to be reserved for Sharman who shines equally in dramatic as well as funny scenes. Kareena, sadly, has been relegated to a corner but makes her presence felt in a few well-enacted sequences, but it's Boman Irani who comes up with the best performance in the ensemble with his brilliant portrayal of an eccentric professor. His jawline protruded, his brows pursed, his gait ungainly, his speech lisped, Irani is every bit the vile and virulent Virus he's supposed to be."
"Motivational movie","9 December 2013","7","I really loved this movie. When you don't understand the logic why people around you stress the importance of studies, then probably the best motivational movie around to watch is '3 idiots'. Aamir (Rancho) showed how dedication and hard work in studies can take you to the heights of success. The movie proved yet again that Aamir is one of the best and creative minds in bollywood. One of the rare movies that keep your guessing and maintains the suspense right through the end.The movie is a whole package, its about true friendship and love. A must watch movie. Totally worth watching movie, you wont regret watching it even if you will have to watch it with subtitles."
"A must watch","18 June 2015","7","I had to write a review because of how amazed I was by this incredible movie,I was also surprised that their is only one review.This movie will not only deliver a message but will also be very entertaining delivering the message.I was not bored at all nothing was wrong,my unprofessional opinion is that this movie has no flaws.The message is very clear in this movie (chase excellence success will follow)The acting was really stunning, Aamir Khan was great ,Madhavan and Sharman Joshi were as great and of-course Boman Irani(college directer) we can't ask for a better performance.I also have to say Rajkumar Hirani (the real director) did a great job.I seriously think if this movie is in America it would win an Oscar in Best Picture,Best Directing,Best Actor in a Leading Role,Best Actor in a Supporting Role,Best Music."

"Good. But misses the Bullseye !!!","28 December 2009","7","It certainly is all over town. Aamir's next has been hyped immensely and it's not surprising if you are not able to find a movie ticket this weekend. But at the end it all boils down to the question - is the movie worth all the hype ?? After watching it, I can say that the answer (quite disappointingly) is no.Two college friends - Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) embark on a journey to find the third friend / Idiot Rancho (Aamir Khan) who mysteriously disappeared after college five years ago. The film's story is told through flashbacks as the characters journey to Shimla in search of Rancho - the person who managed to change their outlook towards life.The problem with 3 Idiots according to me is that although it tackles a very complex issue, it chooses to do so in a light-hearted way which essentially converts this movie into a comedy (something present in abundance in B-Town). No doubt the humor is top-notch and keeps you rolling in laughter but the movie simple fails to connect you emotionally with the characters as opposed to, for example, Taare Zameen Par (2007) which I feel, after watching this, is far more superior in terms of characterization and emotional depth. By the time it reaches the climax, you can well anticipate almost everything that would happen.As for the performances, they are top-notch. Undeniably, Aamir is one of the finest and this movie reaffirms this. However, what most people seem to be forgetting is that there are two more actors in this movie who, given the opportunity, are as capable as Aamir themselves. First R. Madhavan as Farhan Qureshi is simply brilliant. Watch the scene wherein he tries to explain his point of view to his parents. Next, Sharman Joshi as Raju Rastogi really shines not just in the comic sequences but in the more serious ones (which the movie has very few). Revealing the sequence in which he shines may act as a potential spoiler but watch out for a scene in the principal's office in which the principal asks him to type a rustication letter. Kareena Kapoor is really a thorn in this movie and her romance with Aamir is something that should have been either toned down or chopped off. Omi as the ideal geek is impressive (more so than Kareena).The cinematography is good and breathtaking in the opening song where the lush greenery of Shimla is captured with such finesse that it induces a sense of wonder. The music is good but the songs have not been used that effectively. For instance, ""Give Me Some Sunshine"" not only has weak choreography, but it comes at a moment which severely reduces its impact. The promo featuring that song was far superior (in fact that was what fooled me into believing that this movie could end up as a masterful lesson in life). Some of the sequences could have been trimmed down.On the whole, although 3 Idiots is a good movie, it is hard to understand people calling a masterpiece or a breakthrough in cinema. Movies like Taare Zameen Par (2007) or even Hirani's own Lage Raho Munnabhai (2006) are better movies as compared to this. Nevertheless, the movie does provide some really good entertainment so if you're looking forward to just relax and chill out, go for this. For those however seeking some serious depth and a perspective in the life of an engineer, I'd say the movie tries and succeeds in parts but an engineer's life and the pressures s/he faces are a different game altogether. Although the movie it enjoyable, it is far from authentic. And this comes from an Engineer (although an Idiotic one). Now I may get a lot of sore thumbs down on this one but this in my opinion on this movie written in all earnestness. Don't enter this movie with high expectations and you may perhaps find that All Izz (Indeed) Well !!!Score: 7.0/10.0 !!"

"Overrated","7 August 2014",NA,"Okay!!! Don't get me wrong when I say the movie is overrated. The movie is great, it's entertaining, it's fun to watch with a group. But, when you watch it more than once, you will find so many flaws with it that it is sometimes embarrassing. Also the movie is very long with lots of unnecessary and silly scenes in it. The movie could have been great if the editing department would have been better.Some scenes and characters are exaggerated. The delivery scene is weird. But, all things considered, it is good movie. It has all the right emotions to pull the viewer in and hold him till the end. But the movie is a bit clichéd for my liking. Go for it if you like the typical Bollywood stuff and this movie will entertain you every time you watch it."
"Fairly idiotic, but it's not that bad","1 October 2011","1","Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots is generally a rather entertaining comedy, but as a film it is only partially successful. Though it does have its moments, it never really manages to completely deliver and lacks the power to enthrall. It mostly works as a senseless comic ride and only occasionally does it convince when it tries to convey a message. The film is quite messy in presentation, and it is a tiresome task to follow the proceedings as every now and then the story moves confusingly between past flashbacks and present developments. The movie is good in many ways, and at times it's very funny, but it is the overall product which is faulty. The dialogue is for the most part excellent, so is the visual style, but then, the script lacks focus. While Hirani's direction is quite smart and creative at times, he often tries to include too many elements, and, as a result, the movie often seems to go nowhere. The humour wavers between witty moments of hilarity and cheap, unoriginal gags. And then we also have poor sequences of overdone melodrama and manipulative sentimentality, which are incorporated rather forcibly into the movie and they really fall flat. The entire birth sequence, for one, is one hell of a cliché. So is the ending, which is sugarcoated to the max. Where acting goes, the one who does the best--and probably the only great--job is definitely Boman Irani, who is simply hilarious as the lisping, authoritarian college professor. Aamir Khan looks younger than his actual age but is still too old for his role. Acting-wise, he's just ordinary and offers nothing particularly impressive. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi are given little scope and only few short episodes here and there for themselves so that they don't end up unsatisfied from taking part in this film. They do reasonably well, but Joshi is made to cry far too much, and it really gets on one's nerves. Now who's left? Oh, Kareena Kapoor! Well, she is pretty but she is given a thankless blink-and-miss part which is neither significant nor demanding. That said, though she is hardly there, she does well when she is and her presence is pleasant. The songs are quite catchy and fun, but none of them is particularly memorable. ""Zuby Duby"", however, is superbly visualised and is enjoyable enough. Overall then, 3 idiots is an okay film at best which is flawed and terribly overrated, but in all fairness, it is reasonably enjoyable and may provide decent Hindi entertainment for the entire family. According to me, it is worth nothing more than a one-time watch."
"For smiting those who are lame enough to give this movie a one or a two star rating","12 July 2013","1","An experience to behold. This movie evoked the extremities of my emotions. Most here on IMDb have appropriately lauded this flick, so any more appreciation on my part will simply turn out to be quite monotonous. I have penned this review to ponder aloud on the narrow lives of those who hated this flick enough to give it a one star rating.Frankly, I did not find more than one or two of the one-star reviews genuine. There is this one guy that compares this movie to the other top 250 movies on IMDb. How lame is that! I mean I have known only professional critics juxtapose movies just so that they could rank them; they are simply forced to compare movies. And judging by that particular person's command over the language and his lack of technical knowledge, he was not even remotely associated with any major critic; why then that absurd comparison? This same guy also cited something about the movie liked by 'mainstream dumb folk'. This comment in itself is dumb. Did he know that Shawshank Redemption was a mainstream flick, and that it was rated highly by the same 'mainstream dumb folks'? You are on IMDb for Satan's sake; this is the place where people other than professional critics rate movies. If I was forced to think like critics, I would say that there are more than a couple of movies better than 'Shawshank..'; Pulp Fiction, The Dark Knight, City of God, The Godfather, to name a few. Hope you get the point.There were a couple of other guys who actually slammed the acting. I wonder, do they even know anything about acting? Being an actor of a small repute myself, I would have no qualms against the acting prowess of the performers, apart from a negligible few areas that needed improvement. And from a consumer's eyes, they made me believe, and there is no higher praise than that.Well, if they are hard-to-please enough to rate the movie a one, why didn't any of them comment on the direction? That is because either there were hardly any points in regards with direction that they could criticize, or they are not literate enough to even know anything about direction.There was this other guy that liked 'Five Point Someone' more. He felt that the movie didn't do justice to the novella. I can only say that the person's list of favorite books would most certainly not be to my taste. I obviously won't say this unless I had read the book, and I wonder how it was successful commercially. The movie is way better than the book. Hell, I shouldn't even be comparing the two.Some other guys claimed that the movie wasn't realistic. Now, since when has the Dark Knight, The Lord of the Rings, The Godfather, Shawshank, Psycho, or Casablanca - I could go on and on - been realistic. Some of them may have been based on a real phenomenon, but they certainly were not out-and-out realistic. We watch and appreciate these movies just for the cinematic experience they offer. So don't give that realism crap. Movies are meant to be a figment of someone's imagination depicted artistically.Some even quoted the movie's similarity to Munnabhai MBBS. Wow, I don't see where that has come from. It's like 'Django Unchained' is 'Reservoir Dogs' all over again. Wake up call! They are two entirely different movies.Don't even get me started on other haphazard criticisms. There were only 2 or 3 people in the one-two star club that convinced me in regards to their rating. Others seemed more like wannabes or trolls, or simply sad souls. I gave this film 8 stars, and dropped 2 stars primarily because of the songs, and its unnecessary larger-than-life portrayal. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie."
"3 Idiots, Hattrick from Rajkumar Hirani!","26 December 2009",NA,"I saw this movie on the first day of it's release. My expectations were terribly high from this movie since the Rajkumar Hirani's last two outings were absolute rock solid products in Indian cinema. Somehow Rajkuamr Hirani managed to make 3 Idiots so damn good that he surpassed my expectations! First of all, the casting.. though we have seen Aamir, Sharman and Madhavan in Rang De Basanti together, they still look very fresh together, maybe it is because of the college factor and mainly because Aamir seriously looks like a student in this movie. Boman Irani just had to be part of this movie because he was also there in Raju's last two. Kareena is also there.The performances, Aamir has performed brilliantly. He is the total package in this movie! We all know how dedicated Aamir is towards his movies and roles. Aamir analysed the body language of the youth nowadays, the way they talk, and all the connecting details and he implemented them in his acting, which is very visible. He also manages to look 21 when he is actually 43 while shooting this movie! Aamir delivers a power performance, each time Aamir enters the screen you feel immense energy and know your either going to laugh really hard or enjoy the sequence that is going to come! R. Madhavan is very very impactful as Farhan and delivers a great performance, he is known for his impact in movies, even when he has a small role. Well in this one he has a big role, which is only better! Sharman Joshi is absolutely convincing as Raju, the guy that has so much pressure on him. His expressions and everything are marvelous and I thoroughly enjoyed him in this one.Boman Irani is fantastic yet again, he surpasses all his previous performances and sets a new milestone in his own career. He is just great! Kareena is there for a few minutes, and is effective, though she should have been there more! The concept of the movie is absolutely amazing, we all know Rajkumar Hirani makes movies with a great entertainment value, but at the same time an intelligent social message. He is able to do that again this time, and how! Rajkumar also sends a new hype into the population of India, with Munnabhai MBBS it was the ""Jaadu ki jhappi"", with Lage Raho Munnabhai it was ""Gandhigiri"", and with 3 Idiots it is ""Aaaaal izzz well!!"". I am already using this line on a daily basis, lol! The music of the movie is great, Shantanu Moitra's songs always grow on people slowly, after coming from the movie, all the tracks have been stuck on my head, plus point for sure! The cinematography is top notch again, they have shot at a real college, with real students around. Which creates a very convincing atmosphere in every sequence! The editing of the movie is very very good.All in all, 3 Idiots has impressed me so much, that I am willing to say this is the best Bollywood movie I have seen YET! A true milestone in the history of Indian Cinema.GO WATCH IT WHILE YOU STILL CAN! P.S. There are some ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS sequences in the movie that are going to make you cry because of laughter for sure! 100/10"
"One of the best Indian movies I have seen...","27 December 2009","8","Superbly made movie. All actors have done a splendid job but as always Aamir has acted his heart out. His performance stands out...one of his top 3 performances I would say...What makes this movie special is the way facts (positive as well as negative) about our education system have been put forth. Serious issues like students committing suicide under the pressure of performing well in the academics make you sad, concerned and angry at the same time. Another point to be noted is, Rajkumar Hirani has done an exceptional job in getting a college student out of all 3 actors (Aamir, Madhavan and Sharman)I strongly recommend watching this movie. Don't miss it."
"A landmark entertainer in Indian Cinema!","27 December 2009","8","""Chase excellence and success will follow"". This is what Rancho (Aamir Khan) preaches in 3 Idiots and Rajkumar Hirani delineates the ideology with such adroitness in every aspect that it marks a monumental event for Indian cinema. In terms of the sheer inspiration that it instigates, this film resembles the greats of 'Rang De Basanti', 'Taare Zameen Par' and the 'MunnaBhai' series while being the most entertaining film after 'Andaz Apna Apna'. After introducing simple but relevant concepts like 'jaadu Ki jhappi' and Gandhigiri to the population at large, Hirani now teaches us 2 more concepts:Consoling the heart by saying 'all is well' may not solve your problems but it will give you the courage to face them. Being an 'idiot' in an institution that chases grades and success is absolutely fine if you are in the pursuit of gaining knowledge and exploring your own talent to its potential. Our system needs to evolve in order to encourage us to pursue what we really want to do with our lives. As Rancho rightly criticizes the Director of the ICE about the college having produced numerous rankers but not a single student who has been creative enough to invent anything with what he has learned. 2 of the idiots, Farhan (R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) leave everything they're up to and along with their dorky college buddy Chatur (Omi Vaidya) begin a journey in search of their long lost friend Rancho, who left them abruptly several years ago. This beautiful journey through Shimla, Manali and Ladakh sends Farhan down memory lane to reminisce the manner in which a free spirited 'Rancho' entered their lives and changed them forever. The non-conformist Rancho rightly questions authority that suppresses free thinking. Every class that he attends is a revelation of sorts for the professor and the students alike. Through outrageously funny incidents and scenes, Rancho gradually changes the way his friends run the relentless race. His influence even spreads to the director's daughter Pia (Kareena Kapoor), leading to even more outrage for the Virus. Through all the hilarious series of events, Hirani also voices his ideologies in some deeply moving scenes to give us an insight into the flaws of the educational system. Its demands are severe on students who are forced by parents who dream for them on their behalf and families that live in sheer misery hoping for the son to become a money-making engine. The latter is humorously depicted as a typical 1950s family in black and white melodrama that makes you sympathize and laugh at the same time. Touch of genius there...Even after a shocking twist at the end of first half, the film continues its pace while never losing the steam of entertainment. The film's climax is shot in the spectacular landscapes of Ladakh. Speaking of which, the cinematography CK Muraleedharan is outstanding! After painstaking attempts to shoot at the heavenly location, he did manage to catch it in all its majestic splendor. His work overall gives a real, enriching look to the film. Shantanu Moitra's music WILL not sound like the most appealing when listened to prior to watching the film. It is the manner in which the songs are timed in the storyline and the relevance of the lyrics with the characters that enables the music to grow on you. Give me some sunshine and Behti hawa are the examples of this. All is well was a super-hit from the on-set itself with its catchy theme. As the usual case is with Hirani's films, the performances are impeccable. Boman Irani as the oppressive director must feel at home with his role as a dean but he still has the ability to impress us with his remarkable portrayal of Virus. Kareena Kapoor has proved her talent in a role that did not require her Kambaqt Ishq attire but rather her true self as a good actress who, when given the right role to work with can prove to be worthy. Omi Vaidya is a discovery here. His speech on stage is one of the most hilarious moments in movies and his inept Hindi and dorky behavior are aspects of his brilliant performance. R. Madhavan shows finesse and a lot of confidence in playing his character. His scene with his father, Parikshit Sahni is the epitome of his performance. Sharman Joshi has displayed his comfort with comedy before and it is a delight to watch him repeat his act from Rang De Basanti rather than that of his other films. Aamir Khan once again, shines light on a rich, well scripted character. His brilliance levels with his commitment as an actor. He proves yet again that true performances only come with understanding and studying the character that one has to portray. He frankly has too many noteworthy scenes but he is at his best while confronting the impregnable Virus. He is the voice of Hirani's ideas and creativity and an astounding personification of a character only he could've played with such virtuosity.But 3 Idiots is not all about how great Aamir was. This film is extraordinary because it gets the most rudimentary part of film making right - the screenplay and script. With the combined talents of Abhijat Joshi and himself (story, screenplay, dialogs), Hirani's basics in film making achieve overall perfection. There is something unique and entertaining happening in every scene and you would kick yourself if you take a restroom break.It would suffice to say that 3 Idiots is a landmark film and is set to become one of the biggest blockbusters by the virtues of Rajkumar Hirani and that of his immensely talented team including some of the finest actors. This film deserves multiple viewing and you know what?.... You'd still want to watch it again.9.505 on a scale of 1-10."
"this movie need no words","29 December 2009",NA,"I don't post as often as i watch movies. because i think people don't want to know individual opinions, as every movie is for a certain category of viewers. however i so much wanted to write a review on this movie coz i want everyone out there to watch this movie. its the best out there. and i would recommend to book a second show for the same movie in advance..coz you would want to watch it another time right away. there have been only two instances with me when i wanted to see a movie again back to back after watching it first time. the first time was with DCH. eight years back. please do go and watch this movie... its awesome"
"Best Movie","29 December 2009","10","I saw this movie on Thursday on its first show this is one of superb movie made in this decade in Indian Cenema Plot is superb, Acting is superb, Songs are superb..The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervalsThe movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Omi Vaidya (Silencer) were superb in their roles.. Aamir did a great Job, this is One of his Best movie.....Other Actors like Mahadevan and Sharman Joshi are also Superb. Karina Looks fine in small role given to her so i rate 10 out of 10 to this one"

"Superb movie, a must watch","25 December 2009","7","Amir and Bomman Irani rocks!!! Amir has done it again! A must watch at least once!!! Karina looks gorgeous. Madhavan and Sharman also look impressive. Fantastic comedy. Shooting in Ladhak is very beautiful. Movie is superb depicting Indian education system's drawback. Amongst the performances, Aamir Khan is stupendous as the system-breaker Rancho. A special mention for Boman Irani who is principal as 'Virus'.Music score, which may have sounded okay sort in the audio version, comes alive on screen with pakka lyrics. Finally one come out of theater humming ""Aal Izz Well"" tune. Hence guys go and watch at least one"
"A hilarious and very much Bollywood conceptualization of 2 stories","28 February 2014","7","Its definitely a fun movie, without doubt. Copied ideas? Yes! Melded a whole lot of stories that the Indian audience don't know? Yes! Made it purely entertaining and relate-able to the Indian mass? Yes!!What's wrong then? Should have given credit to the stuff they were 'inspired' from... so that we could check out those classics too afterwards and appreciate the original work too.You should definitely see 3 Idiots, before seeing the 'inspirations' to totally appreciate the work. And after watching the movie... give a couple of weeks (if u liked it) and then watch 'The Paper Chase' (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070509/) and read the book 'Five Point Someone' (by Chetan Bhagat). Both the old school movie and the book are definitely worth reading and makes you appreciate the movie that bring all these together. *spoiler* There was a hilarious scene which I later found out was from a NZ commercial. Watch this only after watching and appreciating the movie :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXRZcJI9yx8*spoiler end*Watch 3 Idiots if you have not read Chethan Bhagath prior to it. Read the book after if you haven't already...because that was 1 of his books worth appreciating. Watch 'The Paper Chase' also afterwards. You can even just listen through parts of it instead of actually watching...rather than listening to the menagerie of songs that gets you off track in 3 idiots at times."
"Another mix bag from Bollywood, but we love it!","21 January 2010",NA,"When did the last time you had the feeling while watching a Bollywood movie that you are watching the best film ever and then suddenly after the movie gets over you start to get mixed feelings about the movie you saw. Admit it; it has frequently been this way. And then what do you do, you go to watch the movie repeatedly to reinstate your earlier feeling about the movie. The hysteria and invincibility that Bollywood makers manage to create in their storytelling, is what makes it so special. '3 Idiots' is the latest of such hysterical movie with such aura around it.Rajkumar Hirani's latest offering is based on a popular cult novel '5 point someone' by Chetan Bhagat'. So, it's easy to have lot of expectations for this film right? Wrong! See, this is not Chetan Bhagat's first novel adaptation to the big screen, it's his second. The first one was a disaster called 'Hello' based on his book 'One night at a Call Center'. Hence, there were lots of apprehensions about his latest book to screen adaptation. But hopes were there for the creative team for the film production and the star of the film Aamir Khan. Both Rajkumar and Aamir have impeccable record and status in the industry. Hence, the opening they got for this film was not surprising, even with the steep Ticket prices. But, when the word of mouth began that this is the best bollywood movie ever made, the expectations crossed the limits. And the film about three engineering students in Imperial College of Engineering (a.k.a. a reference to Indian Institute of Technology) does not disappoint. The story is with difference, but the characters are clichéd and true stereotypes of their species. Even the several of the movie sequences that make us laugh in the movie are far beyond being original. But the story is new and relevant to today's youth. Engineering and medical fields of study has started to take a toll on today's youth and the more than half a dozen student suicides that you would witness and hear in the movie is not at all a overreaction. It is turning into an epidemic; hence this film is definitely important. The young India is lapping up the support this film provides to their cause with great hysteria and is enjoying the many jokes and potshots the movie takes on the countries rigid educational system and social norms. The quirky and over the top turns that the lives of these idiots take is bringing joy and happiness to the young India. I should mention the best written character and surprisingly the best actor of the film 'Chatur'. Chatur is the typical Indian student that one sees around the campuses of Indian Colleges. Played by newcomer Omi Vaidya, it is the character the audience loved to see fail. Though he does not, his sequences have brought cheers across college campuses in India. The hysteria of '3 Idiots' becomes easy to decipher for the Indian audience and hence they are flocking the theater with large numbers and are cheerfully encouraging the next person to go watch the film.For rest of the world this film is irrelevant and has nothing new to offer in terms of the movie flow and character development. But if they are able to put that aside, they would too probably enjoy the funny moments that this movie provides and would end up saying that this is the best Bollywood film they have ever seen."
"Great entertainment...","24 January 2014","8","""3 Idiots"" is a comedy movie and it will entertain you very much and I am sure that you will like it. When I heard the title of this movie I thought that this movie it will not be nice but after I saw the trailer of it I reconsider my opinion and I saw it.I want to tell you that ""3 Idiots"" is a great movie and I like it, don't judge a movie by its title. I also liked the interpretation of Aamir Khan who was really great such as Madhavan was.Finally I have to tell you that the songs of this movie are really nice and I liked them. Rajkumar Hirani did great job in the direction of this movie and this is obvious throughout the entire film."
"1 Idiot","20 October 2015","8","I feel like a fool wasting three hours on what practically is the Indian equivalent of the Three Stooges. With some context, this was the first Bollywood film I had seen, and it doesn't make me want to rush back and view more. The jokes are pretty unfunny, almost inline with unintelligent slapstick comedy and weird foreign comedy. Nothing in this film made me want to continue viewing; poor acting, a poor script and horrible cinematography are among the worst I've ever seen.3 Idiots may be a favorite in it's homeland, but as a foreign viewer to India, I had a huge problem with viewing it. The jokes fall flat, very flat and the story feels juvenile and childish. 3 Idiots is among the worst in IMDb's top 250 and I discourage viewing at all costs."
"fantastic Entertainment","27 December 2009",NA,"most awaited movie was finally on screen all i could say is we need such kind of movies, something different this movie mainly focus on young generation, when parents want them to become doctor and engineer only, this movie teaches how important is to take decision on our career based on our interest and not by force or by money wise , Also this movie tells up fact on teaching culture where student are thought how to be a book worm rather than creating interest in learning, and real time experience. how this create mental effect on them, some crying moments and fun in between movie makes movie live through outi feel no one feel boring through out the movie every character played was best boman, karina,sharman and madhavan were fantastic and obviously amir was main show of movie thanks"
"Bollywood comedy blockbuster: pee jokes and wholesome life values","30 January 2010","7","Released around Christmas 2009 in over half a dozen countries '3 Idiots' , reportedly the highest grossing Bollywood movie of all time, earned $70 million worldwide within 18 days of entering theaters. It was also officially released early to YouTube, another first. In the US, where it's being being shown at AMC/Regal theaters, it made $5.5 million in its first 17 days, the highest US take for a Bollywood import.So what is this paragon? No 'Slumdog,' it's much more a standard commercial Indian film product. That means it's long, it's got tears, laughter, excitement, music and dance, and homilies about work and family. It's got romance, a beautiful girl who finds the hero in the end, and it's got running pee and fart and bum jokes. The screenplay of '3 Idiots' is drawn from Chetan Bhagat's 2004 bestseller Five Point Someone, a novel initially published in English and later reissued in Hindi. Bhagat's novel deals with the college exam angst and romance issues of three student buddies. But the film goes further afield, including childbirth during a blackout due to a monsoon flood, travels through gorgeous mountain landscapes of Ladakh seen from the air, trips back and forth over the period of a decade, one marvelous scene when a professor's mass of equations and symbols float off the blackboard up into the lecture hall, caressing the students. There are several full-dress Bollywood song-and-dance numbers, one in a hospital. The bright-colored cinematography is pleasant to look at. '3 Idiots' is virtually an epic of shared coming-of-age experiences with wholesome messages. These are: be true to yourself, live your dream. Be positive: the hero's mantra is ""Aal izz well."" Don't cheat -- unless you have to in a good cause. Don't rely on memorizing stuff; think for yourself. Avoid obsessing about the price and value of things. Remember where you came from. Remember your friends. The pressures of school in India where it may be the only way out of poverty are made clear, including the high incidence of suicide among students.And learn Hindi. There's a sequence when a nerdy materialist who lived abroad and didn't study it much is chosen to give a public address in a high-falutin literary form of the language, ending up with some lines in Sanscrit, which he's even more ignorant of. The buddies inject naughty substitute homonyms like the equivalent of ""screw"" for ""serve"" and he becomes a laughing stock.It's this materialistic memorizer bloke, Chatur Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya), who starts off the pre-title sequence by calling Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) to say he's located their engineering school pal ""Rancho"" (Aamir Khan) who disappeared after graduation. Farhan has to take the annoying and materialistic Chatur along as he rounds up best buddy Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) to drive from New Delhi up to the mountain town of Shimla to find Rahcho, the pal who influenced and inspired them so much. Much of the film consists of flashbacks along the trip of all the many incidents that happened in engineering school, many involving the annoying and sadistic school principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), AKA ""Virus,"" who has a beautiful daughter, Pia (Kareena Kapoor).The mercurial and diminutive Khan is so talented he gets away with playing Rancho as a student even though he's forty-something. Rancho is a compelling character: he's the inspiration, the catalyst a young person needs to move beyond his origins and live his dreams. Farhan is from a middle class family and has a huge talent for nature photography; his dad has pushed him toward engineering but he hates it. Raju comes from a dirt poor family -- images of his sick father, unmarried sister, and failing mom are in old-movie black and white -- and the way the family's future is resting on his engineering degree so terrifies him that he continually panics and fails the school tests. But he's a tremendously decent, soulful fellow whose rigorous honesty ultimately wins over potential employers. Rancho, whose origins are as obscure as his brilliance is evident, bows to no one and gets away with all kinds of infringements of the rules because or his inventive mind and fundamental decency.This summary barely scratches the surface. '3 Idiots' moves with precipitous speed through a dizzying array of incidents. A puzzling surprise comes just before the mid-way ""Interval."" And I said it was long. With that ""Interval,"" the movie keeps you in the theater for three full hours. That's a lot of Hindi, and only a little English. But this feels like a cleansing, warm bath after Judd Apatow and Eddie Murphy. This is good entertainment, and it's neither mindless nor nasty. But is it art? Is it groundbreaking? No, one couldn't say that. It's just a breath of good humor and good sense from a more innocent place."
"Over-hyped Movie. Good fun for half the way","29 December 2009","7","I watched this movie yesterday with my family. To begin with, I quite liked the concept about engineering college and the pressures. There were a lot of funny scenes which had the audience in splits. The comic timing of all the actors Amir, Sharman Madhavan and Boman Irani was really good. Chatur is just remarkable, what a launch for him. And when I came out at the interval i was pretty happy. I thought the film would continue in the same way in the second half.But the second half was too filmy. I mean what was Javed Jaffry s character doing in the film? His character was most confusing and unbelievable. I felt that the romantic angle was totally unnecessary and a bit forced as if just introduced to put some masala in the flick. Had the writers stuck to the basic plot about fun in college and avoided romantic side-angles, it would have been more crisp and slick.I thought the film would focus also on all the fun in other years, college fests labs etc. But they missed out on all that. And, the pregnancy scene could have been avoided. That was too ""filmy"". But otherwise, good story with a nice social message about the lopsided educational system in India. Hope some teachers and people involved in the education industry watch this movie and try to do something to correct our outdated, one-sided education system.There is another thing that stands out in this movie- the cinematography. whether its the college ambiance at IIM Bangalore or Shimla or Ladakh etc. has been nicely captured. Music is also good and keeps you entertained.That said and done, this movie is just an entertainer.Just leave your brains at home while watching this, especially the in the second half."
"A fresh coming of age tale with a big heart!","5 January 2015",NA,"I just finished watching 3 Idiots and was rather glad I gave it a chance! The high rating on IMDb roused my attention to its existence, however the title seemed to suggest some slapstick tale (of which I am also partial too from time to time), though as I read the synopsis I became intrigued with the premise of a comedy/drama/Bollywood/musical set mostly in a college campus. I couldn't think of anything I'd ever seen before falling into all of these categories simultaneously and I also felt I needed to give Bollywood a bit more of a chance as my repertoire is quite slim in this department to date! I won't say much about the plot (my summary is about as much as I'd like to give away), as I watched the movie pretty blind of what was to unfold and I really felt swept away in what at times felt like an epic journey of twists and turns; nothing too ridiculous to prompt a 'WTF?!' response, I felt the pace of the film moved really nicely along with realistic and believable scenarios interjected not for shock value but to aid the storytelling. The characters were well fleshed out and I really came to feel a sort of camaraderie with this not altogether hapless but lovable bunch with the main character Rancho, especially likable despite his bad-boy status with the Director of the college 'Virus'. Sometimes I felt a few scenes played out a little like a spoof, feeling slightly cheesy, however I have a feeling some of this vibe came from the cultural gully you often find with having to rely on subtitles (though as another reviewer said, pidgin English is used throughout the film so sometimes you don't need the subtitles). If musicals make you cringe then I guess you may feel a bit like the scenes with sporadic bursting into song are unnecessary, but you have to not only expect this from Bollywood films but also value it as an important part of the storytelling in its own right; plus, the songs in this film are catchy, well crafted and appropriate for the mood attempting to be set. As a final note, if someone was to ask me 'what makes a great movie?', I'd probably answer something like this; It should make me laugh and maybe cry, then come away thinking more about the film and its underlying meanings. Characters should be well formed enabling me to fall in love with them (or even begin to hate them) so, caring if they live or die; to feel their pain and joy and be able to absorb myself into their adventure as though just one of the gang. The look of a film should make me want to make screen-shots just so I could take a closer look at the subtle fleeting beauty that is a single frame, and together, the mosaic of images creating a flow so appealing to the eye that it lends a resonance to the script and plot without distracting you from the deeper message. With that in mind I'd say '3 Idiots' succeeded on many levels and left me feeling satisfied, unlike many highly praised blockbusters of late which have left me feeling jaded and apathetic. There are a couple of scenes where, should I dare say it, 'The Sound of Music' came to mind, though I won't say why other than perhaps the beautiful scenery and the innocent feel to the actions of the characters in comparison to the overly sassy and promiscuous teenager of many Hollywood films these days. Overall, I think my score of 8 is fair given how the movie made me feel, it's lasting impression on me and the fact that I could easily watch it again- perhaps even adding it to my favorites list. I would recommend others to give it a go, even if you're not partial to musicals or Bollywood, or subtitles- so what?! You can always be surprised and I have a feeling you might be!"
"Amazing & Inspiring! One of the Best!","1 October 2014","1","In my opinion, ""3 Idiots"" is one of the best films that I have ever watched. The directing was unique. The acting was outstanding and very natural. The cinematography was very clean and smooth. The story was amazing and inspiring. The musical parts are fantastic. For me, it is a perfect film. I liked every thing about it. The TRT was approximately 3 hours, yet every seconds and minutes of it was perfection. At first I thought it was just like the same ""common"" type of comedy film. But I was wrong, it was different. It was unique in many ways. The mixture, chemistry and transitions of comedy and drama of this film was done perfectly. This is the kind of film that all people should watch. This is the kind of film that will teach you a lot of moral lessons in life. This film will help enlighten people and I promise to all that this film will change your life."
"ALL TIME FAVE COMEDY DRAMA MOVIE.","31 March 2019","1","A heartfelt movie that gives many social lessons. Watching this movie from start to finish feels like experiencing an entire journey along with these characters all the way. It makes u have a good and fun time as well making u think. I watched it 100 times already and u will still like it. Funny, inspiring, emotional, teaches many lessons, tells how to live!!! BRAVO!! 🏅"
"Good entertainment","27 September 2011",NA,"It does not really matter whether this is intentional on the part of the movie makers or just my own imagination – the three Indian leads, in order of their appearances, resemble Mark Ruffalo, Gael Garcia Bernal and Tony Curtis (some would say Tom Hanks). Whatever that is, it certainly doesn't hurt the movie at all, nor does the winsome eye-candy female lead.The plot outline and story detail combine familiar stuff with some innovations. Starting with ""ten-years-later"", it employs the proved structure of flashbacks to recount the days the three protagonists share at college day when they cemented a heart-warming friendship – a full entertainment package complete with comedy, romance, breathtaking scenery, mild poignancy and even some ""messages"" with respect to the nature of education. On the last score I won't get overboard although some critics may make a big thing out of it. I rarely look at a movie as anything beyond entertainment, and those who believe that a 2-hour movie can double up as a full semester of philosophy, sociology, political or whatever ""100"" course are welcomed to continue to indulge in their delusion. By the way, this is actually a 3-hour movie. Word-of-mouth recommendations I received unanimously agree that the 3 hours would fly by without one's noticing it. I generally agree, but not 100%. There are times in the middle when it drags on somewhat, although the last half hour of finale is redeeming. Knowing what Bollywood is like, one shouldn't complain too much about the song-and-dance sequences appropriately sparsely inserted. After all, they even have such things in Ozon (""8 femmes"" 2002)), so what's the fuss? And I have to admit that the rhythmic tunes are quite enjoyable. The only downside is that the resultant length gave an excuse to the local cinema operators to hike the admission price – a bit of a rip off.All told, this is a good entertainment package, price hike notwithstanding."
"Very joyful movie !","4 December 2012","10","I watched it finally on DVD.The film is very good in every sense It's players , dances , winding key was too perfect You can laugh and cry in this film the film is entertaining ,feeling and meaningful There is perfect an Indian dance such as in every Indian film.Story Two friends Raju Rastogi(Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi(R.Madhavan) embark on a quest for a lost buddy Rancho(Aamir Khan). On this journey, they encounter a long forgotten bet, a wedding they must crash, and a funeral that goes impossibly out of control.I loved every moment of this movie. and I hope to watch a lot of future Indian movies like this.The movie is highly recommended to 'students' specifically."
"Beautiful","7 September 2015","10","I usually don't like movies from India. Specially because of cultural differences between west and east. However, this movie was different. The first half of movie had, indeed, a lot of Indian movie characteristics that made me feel the difference between hollywoodian movies and the bollywoodian - I suppose there is where this movie came from - ones. Besides the funny parts - expected from a self described comedian movie - the movie was disappointing me... until it started the second part. This final part added the drama needed for a perfect movie: it showed us real human problems. Even more: it showed how to solve it. All in a funny way. The main problem of the movie was: should we follow our heart to do what we like in our professional choice or just do what our parents ""suggests""? Other secundary problems - but not less important - were showed as well and all the adventure to solve it made the movie simply beautiful. Highly recommended."
"3 Idiots","6 January 2011",NA,"First of all, I rarely watch Indian films; secondly, I think this highly-praised Indian film is overrated. There is no doubt this film is a quite entertaining one, but nearly nothing special is worth mentioning here, one can easily feel that the director exaggerate to stuff all kinds of popular elements in its 160 minutes (I like the songs though), universities' educational method, the genuine friendship, money is not the most important item in the world (don't marry an over-materialized man), a choice between what I want to do and what parents want me to do, blah blah blah....The film deals with a quite grand topic, the meaning of life, and luckily its scholastic didactics has not reached my threshold of intolerance, as a result I enjoyed most of its screen time, however, my absent-mindedness did come forth several times. Actually the general principles which the film tried so hard to convey are conventional, everybody knows, what the film achieved is to manifest it in a perfect cinematographic world where everything is too idealized to happen in our mundane world. Lack of empathy and a shoddy script makes the film fade like a forgettable fairytale.All the characters are stereotyped, the suspenses do not persist long enough and the whole film is skimpy of plausible explanations for most its plots. Still I give a 6/10, an eligible rate, thanks to Aamir Khan's lovable performance. I don't think the film represents the highest standard of contemporary Indian films, nevertheless the inconvenient truth is that it failed to encourage me to watch more Indian films at the same time, what else can I do? There are numerous films are waiting in lines for me to watch, I don't want to waste my very limited time."
"Old wine in a new bottle kinda movie..disappointing and below average.","17 January 2010","8","I just managed to catch this movie on TV today and I must say that I have never seen a more disappointing and old wine in a new bottle kinda movie. Lets face it, its a complete blend of Dil Chahta Hai, Rang De Basanti, Munnabhai MBBS..and other lesser known college dramas. The message is way too out-and-out..it could've been subtle, lined with situations carefully and intelligently weaved into the plot. 40 plus actors playing college kids is blasphemous! Stereotypical character development, average acting, old timer jokes..it just doesn't fit. The movie couldn't raise my interest even a bit. And I'd make a special mention of the wedding scene, reminded me of Aamir's Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahi. Its just one of those typical Bollywood mix 'n' match flicks with absolutely no soul. I really don't understand the hype and hoopla about it. Below average."
"My favorite movie of all time","20 September 2015","8","This is the kind of movie that you can watch over and over again, yet feel like you've never watched it before. The use of comedic flavor and serious drama complement each other perfectly to develop the central theme of the movie (which applies to a lot of people studying in countries where rote memorization is the primary approach used to study). Omi Vaidya is the actor that I felt really stood out in this movie. Aamir Khan and the rest of the core actors did a wonderful job in their roles, but Vaidya presented the perfect impressions of someone who has been corrupted by the flawed educational systems of these Asian countries.As for the rest of the components, they were absolutely outstanding. Hats off to Hirani and Chopra for meticulously developing a very realistic script and conveying a strong, profound message at the end. I felt that the inclusion of some of the songs was unnecessary, but that's just my opinion. This movie does span almost 3 hours, but the 3 hours will pass by like water roaring down from a waterfall.Whenever you get a chance, watch this movie. Not only will you laugh and cry, but you will also be able to take back a very valuable life lesson.10+/10"
"amazingly hilarious but ....","25 December 2009",NA,"i watched the paid preview of this film on Thursday night. i wanted to watch this film for a long time. after the recent release Avatar, this movie was completely in a different league.the first half of this film is too good. although as per my friends, first half has many a scenes lifted from the book - 5 point someone. still the character building and plot setup works really superbly in this part. the jokes might be really old, they have been very well told.Aamir is back to usual comic style that he has shown time n again in Dil Chahta Hai , Rang De Basanti, Andaaz Apna Apna. but actors like Booman Irani, Sharman Joshi and Madhavan are not anywhere behind him. they play their parts really well.in the second half of the film, the story is not left much... so there are certain extended scenes where a few 'ideological' things start happening. the end of the story is quite expected. many a scenes are very typical 'hindi movie' scenes.overall a must watch film.watch out for comic scenes where you can fall off your seats of laughter."
"Great Movie, 3 Hours Full of Emotions, Crying and Laughing","30 November 2013","8","I have seen this movie last year. I had seen ""Like Stars on Earth"" before and I loved it too. As I know this one was similar, and as I really like Amir Khan's movies I decided to watch. I liked this one more than ""Like Stars on Earth"" I am a teacher and in this movie there are great messages for all teachers and especially for parents. Education is the most important thing to have a bright future. Not only for people, also for countries. ""3 Idiots"" show the importance of correct educational choices and how teachers and parents play a very important role. The movie gives that message in an entertaining way but also touch people's heart. Although the movie is about India and Indian educational system, so similar problems happen every corner of the world. After I watched this movie, I knew I would watch it again. I recommended this to my students and my friends. I was not able to watch this movie with my students but I watched it with some of my friends and whoever I watched with or I recommended, loved it."
"Best 3 hours in many many years","25 August 2014","8","Many movies I watch, I try to think of the positive in them so I can give a fair score. This movie, I feel happy scoring it a 10, because it is simply marvelous. I did not have to think of the good things in it, it is just Good.I recommend watching it non stop if you can allocate the three hours. Careful who you watch it with, you will cry many many times.I won't describe the movie for you, it touches on human character. You will love it no matter what.For the comedy part of it, you will simply laugh from happiness. How much better is that than laughing at artificially constructed jokes? Thank yous dearly whoever did this movie."
"My Intro to Bollywood: Comedy, Musical, Melodrama in One","14 August 2011",NA,"I watched ""3 Idiots"" upon the recommendation of my cousin. I believe this is the first complete Bollywood film I have seen. ""3 Idiots"" is a film that goes from the present time, to flashbacks of the lead characters' college days in engineering school. Pals Raju (Sharman Joshi) and Fahran (Madhavan) are looking for their best friend Rancho (Aamir Khan) with whom they have lost contact since graduation. Amidst the juvenile school jokes and musical scenes in bathrooms, the story is sending a serious message that learning is more than just rote memorization. Life is about following your own dreams. It also tells us not to face life with fear, overly relying on religion and charms.There are so many over-the-top scenes in this film which runs more than 2 and a half hours! There was a long scene about a speech where the word ""served"" was switched with something considerably more vulgar. Funny but went on too long. This may be funnier for people who speak Hindi than those of us who rely on translation. There was a very long scene about a storm, a brownout and someone giving birth. Dramatic but again overstretched and unbelievable. There was also an unexpected sequence about suicide that did not sit well with me in this supposed comedy.I personally liked the simpler poignant scenes that deliver a bigger punch, like the scene with the Prof. Virus and the pen, the scene with Fahran and his dad, the final revelation scene at the end. There were also some nice scenes with Rancho and the young doctor Pia about her fiancé who seemed to be more concerned about how expensive things were, than about her. ""3 Idiots"" is generally fun to watch, except when the jokes became too toilet or too mean for comfort. There was a lot of suspension of disbelief at the time sequences of a lot of what happened, sometimes not too logical. I could not believe that the actor who played Rancho, Aamir Khan, was actually already in his mid-40s, and yet there he was still credibly playing a college student. Overall though, I did enjoy this, my introduction to Bollywood film. Time to discover more about movies from this part of the world."
"Must watch!","27 December 2009","8","Just came home after watching 3 Idiots and I can't wait to go back to see the movie again. Absolutely fantastic movie which I believe is going to be one of the classics like Andaz Apna Apna was - an all time favorite movie you could watch any time and any number of times.Raju Hirani comes back with a masterpiece and it has perfection written all over it. Nice story, nice narration, superb acting and great direction. I was hoping the movie wasn't a remake of the book and was glad to see that the basic characters and storyline were picked up and everything else was original. The actors were very believable in their roles - not for once did they look any older than students barely out of their teens and blended really well into their characters. The movie keeps you so into itself and had so much to offer that when interval came, I started wondering what could they come up with for the second half but they came back with something even better!The story is of 3 guys - Aamir Khan as Rancho, Sherman Joshi as Raju and R. Madhavan as Farhan going through their 4 years in an engineering college and beyond. All throughout the movie they were their characters and not actors. The movies is beautifully presented and is a laugh riot and has some very emotional moments. It all fits together and you can totally relate to the characters whether or not you went through those 4 years of engineering college like I did. The storytelling is brilliant and it doesn't have second which I found boring or felt like forwarding.Music is nice - not great but it fits with the movie. The movie also has a message about the education system in India and is very true.10/10 :)"
"Excellent, deserves 9/10 for a Bollywood movie","24 December 2009","8","Thoroughly enjoyed the movie, the college humor, the extremely well done dialogs, picturesque cinematography, nice and fluid flow storyline - in fact most of the movie.Only turnoffs were the over-Bollywoodisation out of the realm of the believable, overdoing gross scenes like repeated showing of male rumps/undies. Some director just don't know where to draw the line. Maybe a Farhan Akhtar was needed for a final editing touch :-)But the movie overall manages to fully entertain and keep you in splits or at times tears during the entire time. Would be a 9.999/10 without the turnoffs - exactly where it falls half a point below ""Dil Chahta Hain"", though personally it is funnier!Extremely well cast. Aamir manages to look younger than ""Rang De Basanti"" or any other recent movie - nice acting too from everyone! Even the LA based Omi Vaidya has done a great job in his first Bollywood movie, as a geeky irritant.Do not miss it for anything!!!"
"One of Bollywood's best. That isn't saying much.","31 August 2011",NA,"Alright. I know the title sucks. The first image it brings to one's mind is three cross-eyed, bald men with fingers shoved up their noses or something, which wouldn't be a lot off the mark from what the real picture is - three college-brats scratching fake, shiny, resplendent buttocks. But Shakespeare said 'what's in a name?' and let us assume that the great bard was not being rhetorical and delve further into the movie.Inspired from the book '5 Point Someone' by Chetan Bhagat, or as some critics call him, Satan Bhagat, or the IIT-IIM-douche bag, the movie is about three college students in Imperial College of Engineering, the best fictitious Engineering college of India. Each has a history of his own, and while the past of two of them is open in front of us like a book, the life of the third is barely revealed in the first half. Raju (Sharman Joshi) is the stereotypical nerd, haunted by poverty and has a paralysed father and a mother with a total disregard for hygiene, while Farhan (R. Madhavan) is the dilemma-stricken, schizophrenic (not literally) who is studying to be an engineer but his alter-ego (not literally) wants to be a wildlife photographer.Much through the initial half, the movie focuses on the trio's life in college. There is fun, frolic and all the other juvenile stuff with occasional mentions of suicide, pressure and the sort. The film tries to accomplish too much in too little only leaving behind a residue of laughter and a feeling of nostalgia for people past their 'my-college- life-was-so-awesome' stage.Rancho (Aamir Khan) is the protagonist of the film. The smartest among the three, he is also the most gregarious and wild. He is a philosopher, experimentalist and conducts innovations in his room or drifts into monologues about success, how-to-study and other inspirational things. Though not a geek, he trumps the obnoxious mega-nerd, Chatur Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) in their results, which marks the inception of a long- lasting rivalry, which soon boils over after Rancho plays a particularly nasty prank on the latter. The rest of the story, as Bollywood cinema goes, is about a ghastly principal with a lisp (Boman Irani), friendship, love, pregnant women giving birth using a vacuum cleaner and other pea-brained escapades.The twist comes mid-way through the movie, thoroughly inappropriate and mistimed. After this point the movies seems to drag on. The humour turns more contrived than nonchalant. The emotions become mawkish instead of touching. There are things that are absolutely implausible in any universe. The movie splashes water onto the sand castle it had built in the first half. The end is hypothetical at its best and this only worsens the case. It manages to leave a 'what the hell just happened?!' taste in your mouth, and I am pretty sure that the movie director, Rajkumar Hirani, wasn't trying to accomplish that.However, the three lead characters play a grace-saving role; Aamir Khan in particular. It is difficult to find chinks in the acting armour. The then forty four year old Khan brilliantly morphs into the twenty- something Rancho. Giving a flawless performance, he makes you happy when he laughs, sad when he cries and sway-along when he dances. There is an innocuous air about him which is highly appealing, with some members of the female contingent even defining it as 'cute.' Sharman Joshi, one of the most underrated actors of Indian cinema, dons the clothes of Raju Rastogi seamlessly. He looks tailor-made for the role; right from being the economically-challenged superstitious nerd, to getting inebriated and imitating the working of an induction motor, his acting is like a breath of fresh air. Though Madhavan appears slightly sidelined as Farhan, he manages to hold onto the boat well. He is overshadowed by the other two, who are more distinctly characterized, but this is covered by the fact that he is also the narrator of the tale. He entertains us with his antics (which involves stopping an airplane on the runway), his affable nature and always being Rancho's faithful sidekick. Boman Irani does a commendable job as the uncanny principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe, a part similar in ways to the evil Dr. Asthana is Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. The others too meander through; Kareena Kapoor, Javed Jaffrey, Mona Singh and so on, each well placed in their shoes, but none leaving a lasting impression.Comparisons with the book are inevitable and the film deserves due credit for being one of those rare books that outdoes its paperback version. But then again, comparisons to a wad of used toilet paper are hardly a standard to go by. Most songs are better than the other blockbusters Bollywood has churned out in recent history. They aid the emotional segment of the film. Yipee for that. While the first half of 3 Idiots is certainly worth a watch, but the latter makes you wish that you'd left the theatre in the intermission."
"Best Movie","26 December 2014","10","The best movie I have ever seen in the history of Indian Cinema. best Comedy, Little bit romantic, Story line was very awesome. The best part is the actor of the film is Aamir Khan, who is best for it. The starting of the film till the end Really Amazing. If i still watch it, it'll make me laugh out loud. Aamir khan the only actor who made such great films in Bollywood. Lagaan, Faana, sarfarosh, Dhoom 3, 3 Idiots And not Pk. PK is also the greatest movie of all time The Sound track of 3 idiots is awesome. I would rate it 9.5/10 'cause it is such an amazing film that can't be describe in words :) Thank Yew for reading my review"

"Another Good Venture from Hirani","28 December 2009","7","Well, three idiots is adopted from ""5 point someone"" novel by Chetan Bhagat and has been shot in IIM B'lore campus. I must admit that Mr. Hirani has come up with another good venture after Munna Bhai and its sequel.3 idiots illustrates the experiences of college life of 3 engineering friends. Unlike usual college comedies, this movie presents a fresh perspective with a message. Pre-interval part is totally hilarious and I can bet the comedy would roll you all in your seats. Just like MunnaBhai(s), Mr. Hirani has sought to bring forward a message through this movie. Therefore, though some instances post interval might appear out of line (must say a bit un-realistic) but viewers would like the overall movie.Aamir, as one of the protagonist, has been phenomenal in this movie as a college going student. Sharman, Madhvan and Boman Irani have also made very good contributions in the movie. Kareena looks good but her role is limited. Direction is good and the movie is set in the backdrop of Delhi.Its certainly worth one time watch.Hope you all enjoy this movie.Regards, MaDdyMacD"
"Draggy Movie","1 January 2010","7","Thankfully I drank coffee during the movie but ran out of m&m chocolates and was desperate to pass the time quicklyTo me a movie is an escapism from reality. I want to be thrilled and entertained. But '3 idiots' was reminding me of the reality and stating the obvious philosophies. It was predictable. Everything was so nice and cheesy. Oh hug me I hug you bullshits repeated over and over again. I love nice people and nice things happening BUT THATS IN REALITY. In the movie I wanted something different......End of the day, I had a sense of accomplishment for sitting through the entire movie."
"The Best Indian Movie","21 October 2016",NA,"I'm not a big fan of Indian movies, but this definitely came into my top 20 best movies. 3 Idiots is a film that talks about university, success, knowledge, friendship, love, comedy, etc. Without ever leaving the viewer bored, can make you laugh and soon after make you think and cry. It is a very good film, which tells a bit about the pressure that students suffer in universities, pressure from teachers and family, the movie does it very well, arises every time the question should I do what I want or what society wants me to do, it really is a film that makes us think about it. Who's student will identify much with the film. The main actors are fantastic and do very well its role, giving emphasis to the 'Rancho' Shamaldas Chanchad played by Aamir Khan, the film revolves a lot around this character and it just improves the value of the film. The soundtrack is incredible, and are sometimes accompanied by funny scenes and very sad too. Definitely the best Indian film to date. I left movie satisfied.Do not follow the success to have excellence, follow the excellence and success will run behind you."
"The best Indian movie I've ever watched!","25 February 2018","2","The review title said it all. Yeah, it's the best Indian movie of all time. It's totally great. The actors are great. The music, the actings and everything is great. It totally shows the education system of our country, Myanmar. That's why i love it. The movie shows the University life is fun and not stressed. A great film to spend your free time. 
As for me, I don't even remember how many times I've watched this movie. If you are searching for a great Indian movie, watch this one. Spending time in this film is totally worth it."
"Really good","6 January 2020","2","I remember watching this after me, my brother and my dad went to a video rental store (When they still existed) and we were picking a movie and we ended up with this one. We didn't really check the name properly and when we came home we felt like ""3 idiots"".Turns out that this movie was really good and we had a great evening watching it."
"Great Film","2 December 2023",NA,"The film is very good it has been very great question mark of our education system these film starts with Rancho is an engineering student. His two friends. Farhan and Raju, Rancho sees the world in a different way. Rancho goes somewhere one day. And his friends find him. When Rancho is found, he has become one of a great scientist in the world and the comedy of the film is very good and the songs of the film is very good Aamir Khan, madhavan,sharman Joshi have been acted very superb and Boman Irani has acted has principal of the college and he acted his lifetime acting and Kareena Kapoor is also very good acting overall the film is very good."
"Story, Acting, Drama - This film has it all","15 July 2022","9","I love that it captures some harsh truth's about the Indian education system but manages to tell it through a hilarious epic story of these three friends (and the love interest, of course).I watched this film in theatres many years ago and it has remained my favourite Bollywood film of all time - thirteen years later.It is funny, dramatic, and captivating - and I have watched this film more times than I can count. Considering the length of the film, that's saying something."
"Good","20 May 2022","9","Best movie.its one of the greatest movie you will ever see in your life. 100% movie.please watch it.It's amazing things. One of The best 5 movie in movie."
"Over the top, over fantasized, not quite as the hype goes","24 February 2010",NA,"I believe its a good movie for an average Indian commercial film goer. Story is different, cant pinpoint which English movie's ripoff it is(like most Indian movies).The comedy is OK, aptly done by very able actors like Amir & Boman irani, other 2 'idiots' provided good support. kareena also justified its selection. The film suffers from over sentimentalism and also its a abit impractical if u have a pragmatic look at it, however not every 1 wants a realistic movie.Few funny moments but not much in it especially if we compare it to earlier 2 big successes of Rajkumar hirani, i.e the 'munna bhai' series.The theme is nothing new as it emphasizes on doing in your life what is your natural talent, this reminds me of 'taare zameen par', & can u guess what is strikingly common?...Yes Amir khan. The 'ace' khan as few may call him does a comedy flick after sometime. He looks abit too old for teenage character but then again this detail is overlooked when that supposed teenager is a good actor like he is.The score of the film is good especially 2 dance numbers.In the end its an over the top comedy flick, average fan of commercial Indian movies & teenagers should love it. Of course i m neither and my taste is better."
"Not all is well.","16 November 2020","10","This film is a mess. It mixed past with present time to tell a story. They completely ignore the most important questions like why Rancho has not contacted his friends in all these years, also why was Pia going marry ""ass"" again if she was proved that he's not worth it. Basicly this film completely ignores what the characters learned in the past and makes them do same mistakes only for the finale of the film for them to make the right choices again. Also this film likes to show many serious issues of the real world but then the next second it puts a terrible joke, so I could not take this film seriously at all. It's such a mess. It had many great ideas, the storyline is great, but it's just such a mess, it tries to mixes multiple genres at the same time which does not help."
"One of the best film.....","28 September 2021","10","Most of them don't live up to their hype, 3 idiots however deserves to be on that list 100%. This film has everything from a diverse cast, to a realistic respectful romance, to accurate and emotional portrayal of suicide and burdens parents put on their children to a well written strong and funny female character and last but not least an amazingly written main character who is played fantastically well. I had not heard of this film but am so I glad i found it! I laughed, I cried, I was utterly confused and i will not be forgetting this film anytime soon. To anyone who has not seen this film GO AND WATCH IT! You won't regret it."
"Genius Idiots","7 January 2010",NA,"As I was approaching the end of the movie, I wished I had a scissor to clip off the last 45 minutes or so from the reel, so that I could leave the movie with a positive note. I fail to understand why would the film maker after delivering successfully the definitive message of ""Follow your heart, not the crowd"", try to show some impractical happenstance of 'vacuum-cleaner delivering a baby' or 'fresh-born-baby responding to Aal-is-well zingle' or 'a runaway bride'. Is it just to cater to the Indian audiences who could only settle for their heroes nothing less than supermen and always believe that miracles do happen in ordinary circumstances? This attitude of ours of seeing geniuses in our heroes had earlier given us before heroes who can sing like Kishore Kumar, fight like Dara Singh and dance like Michael Jackson simultaneously. Now our sensible directors settle only for heroes who can make a model of helicopter, top the class without studying, woo the professor's beautiful daughter, and .....hold your breathe....deliver a baby on a pool table.I don't agree that the movie has ridiculed that much the professors or the educational system. Quite obviously, all that were shown, were clearly for fun. In my engineering career I had never seen a single professor emphasizing in the lectures more on 'bookish definition' than 'understanding'. I don't also believe that a single professor of mechanical engineering would encourage his student to score high grades so that he could get job in an IT firm.Having said all that, I must admit that the director Mr Rajkumar Hirani knows how to move his audiences. With his theme of ""Niceties above rest"", he has always given movies that we can cherish and sometimes show to others to justify our actions (I doubt anyone would actually change his way after seeing any movie). One thing I have noticed that Aamir Khan is always good at these preachy-roles where he is smarter than the rest of the folks on screen and delivers his explanations of your-way-is-wrong-and-my-way-is-divine. Don't get me wrong. He is still my favourite actor and in this movie he has done really well to pass for 20 year old engineering genius. Honestly I have not seen a single movie where Boman Irani has done even an average job. He is excellent as always. From the remaining cast my favourite would be the guy who has played the geek. Music was good especially the 'Behti Hawa sa tha woh' song.I can understand why the Indian youth love this movie. It is the same reason for why people love Five Point Someone on which the movie is based. The 'I- can -so- relate- to- the- story- and- when- I-watched- it-I- relived-my- college -days' argument. I won't rate the movie Highly though I would consider it as a good one-time-watch.(Originally posted @ weirdo-on-movies.blogspot.com)"
"It's good in parts but Okay as a whole.","20 September 2014","10","It's good in parts but Okay as a whole. Aamir Khan this time comes up as an engineering student and does it not so convincingly. He seemed to have been through college not once but many times over, as he started telling 'Say your heart All is Well and things will fall into place'.The movie is about giving freedom to kids and a message to parents, let them be what they want to be do not enforce things on them. This is conveyed in a light sense and in a comical way. Yet, at times it becomes preachy, like the confrontation of Rancho with Virus where Rancho says 'Yeh Marks mere ko samajh aaye hi nahi' and yet not at many other times. It is a parody of itself take the black and white scenes of Raju's family or the scene of Chatur Lingam where he says that after 5 years lets see who will be where. But the good moments are far and only between as a few drizzles in a tropic summer.The cinematography is good only in parts. Like aerial shots of Shimla road and Ladakh scenes otherwise it was just good. The art designing is commendable with the look of college, hostel and other things done well. The editing was not precise as I thought there are lot of things that could have been cut out like the pregnancy sequence in climax. The casting was not apt except Boman Irani as Principal, Chatur Lingam guy the others were clearly not apt. The 3 main protagonists and the heroine were clearly a misfit as none seemed to be students. Acting was average as nothing was so great and so original as if it was never seen. Chatur Lingam was the silver lightning in the otherwise dry acting. Also to mention is Boman Irani as principal.The writing was mediocre as their previous ones were well written and witty Munnabhai movies. And this was an adaptation of Five Point Someone having read that, I can say that the whole backdrop and the characters and only a few situations were picked but the point that was told was different from the book. That book is much worse than this movie. I am not detailing any instances as mostly, I found them silly and stupid.And in parts, hardly a couple, the originality came out. The speech by Chatur Lingam is the saving grace otherwise it was merely pathetic but such instances took it to at least average level.All is surely not well and it's strictly Average - 2/5."
"Awesome movie","30 August 2021","10","Movie with best story and drama. All the actors performed very well."
"Great Movie","31 July 2021",NA,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. Raj Kumar Hirani is a director who fulfills all the entertainment needs of these sub-continental people in his movies."
"Wonderful","25 November 2021","10","The structure of the film is absolutely wonderful. It teaches a lot of things for youngsters. It teaches to handle things calmly, thing practically. Overall its 10/10 for me."
"Love the Movie","21 July 2021","10","This one was the best movie I would like to say. I love it."
"Best Movie forever","12 August 2021",NA,"Three Idiots' is a remarkable ahead of its time Bollywood blockbuster. This film is a comedy movie with strong acting, memorable characters, a perplexing storyline and most importantly, highly motivational movie to choose the right path in your life."
"what an amazing feelgood movie","19 February 2022","9","What a wonderful time for me, to discover Bollywood cinema. This movie will open your heart. I'm stunned at how effortlessly the movie jumps from silly comedy to serious tragedy. ""3 Idiots"" always remains tasteful, even though the Idiots do some really idiotic things. And when it's funny, it is really laugh-out-lound-funny.Why is ""3 Idiots"" so special? Because it grips you completely. It is so colourful and beautifully filmed, the storytelling is really captivating and unusual. I loved the musical bits here and there. The characters are lovable and hilarious (Rancho, The professor at ICE, Silencer). The cliches somehow seem fresh (escaping the wedding with the bride). But more than this, it has a really powerful message about love, true friendship, family and dreams.I asked a waiter at an Indian restaurant to recommend me an Indian movie and he wrote this and 2 other names on a piece of paper. Really happy i saw this movie. It will stay with me."
"One of the best movies ever made in the history of Indian cinema","24 December 2009","9","AK and rajkumar hirani has changed the face on Hindi cinema in this millennium and century. after chal chalein, released this year, 3 idiots is another movie which dealt with the education system, students committing suicide after the results are announced and parents forcing on the students to fulfill their dreams. This movie will be an eye opener to the educationists and parents and I hope they will ask their children's to listen to their hearts and choose their career.I was always against the education system of RAATA culture.RDB team is back. AK is the emperor of the Indian cinema. He did the hat rick by releasing his movie in the December 21st December 2007 taare zameen par, 25th December 2008 ghajini, 25th December 2009 3 idiots.TZP blockbuster, ghajini all time blockbuster and 3 idiots will sure become the blockbuster. right from lagaan till 3 idiots gave consecutively 8 hits. mind blowing and first of its kind in the whole world and his name should be placed in the Guinness book of world record.Rest of the cast did excellent, good, likable work and gave their best.rajkumar hirani like always gave 100 percent and did mind blowing job international directorrating: 5 out of 5"
"A Treat!","12 August 2020",NA,"Interesting coming of age story of three engineering students. '3 Idiots' is funny and heartfelt. In an instant, the film can be as dramatic as it is comedic, both equally effective.The well selected cast is excellent, especially Aamir Khan (who is always excellent). Through a series of events, the film takes us on a journey of self discovery, with a few life lessons as well. There's something here everyone can relate to.Incredibly, for a 3-hour long movie, my attention was glued to the screen the entire time. The humor was naturally funny instead of slapstick. (I can just imagine how Hollywood would have treated this type of film - ugh!). '3 Idiots' is a beautiful film that will make you laugh and cry. This was just brilliant with a wonderful ending."
"Very very good ...","21 January 2022","10","This movie is a masterstroke that rivals 2021's 83, but falls just short. Even so, it is a very humorous and heartwarming tale that features an ALL STAR ensemble cast, incredible musical numbers/dance choreography, and elite level script writing. Definitely watch this over its cheap Spanish counterpart/ripoff ""3 Idiotas"", possibly the worst movie ever to be conceived by man. Would highly recommend. Aal izz well !!!!!!9/10

"The most meaningful goofy movie.","1 November 2020","10","Personal Rating: 7/10I want to keep this review brief, unlike the movie. I tease... though it does have a runtime of 2hr 50mins. However, that time passes by quickly, filled by a series of ""mini"" movies contributing to the overarching storyline of this film. But that's all beside the point.I went into this movie having not seen much Bollywood before, and thinking this was a twist on the 3 stooges. Boy was I in for a rollercoaster. I could tackle this movie as I usually do, dialogue, cinematography, set design, acting, and quality. If I did that, however, this movie would have a much lower rating. If I based my score off of how many people peed on a wall though... I want to acknowledge that this movie is old, many of the cuts and transitions are cheesy to the western world, most storylines were just there for the surprise, and some of the dialogue... ""not it chief.""But,that's not this movie. If you go in expecting Christopher Nolan you will surely leave disappointed. What makes this movie worth watching in my opinion, are the heavy topics, themes, that it covers in a comedic yet straightforward, not pulling punches, way. I don't want to give any spoilers but to name a view of the themes, the robotic flawed nature of the educational system, the issue of suicide caused by stress, parents pushing their dreams on their children, and pursuing things that make you happy. Just by that alone, Woah, this movie is gold. And the comedy, it's fun, keeps it a very enjoyable watch!Major props to the Indian filmmaking culture for making this gem.""All is well!"""
"what is happening to Indian cinema?","20 February 2010",NA,"this is one of the biggest hits this year, but let me tell you this is a movie which u can miss without regret. many scenes that make you laugh does not make a good movie.the scene that i hated most was those guys stealing the question paper and not looking at it(wake up pple this is real world) and the scene where a vaccum cleaner is used to deliver a baby(WTF??????) and making a guy who is in comma sit up by telling jokes.........and kareena waits so long before getting married? it does not happen in India here girls are married off before they are 25. i would like to say this movie is so far from real i think it was made in moon i cant say any more this movie is a waste of time...."
"BEST INDIAN FILM EVER MADE","18 August 2023","6","Three Idiots is a groundbreaking Bollywood hit that was released ahead of its time. This film is a comedy with great acting, unique characters, a complex plot, and, most importantly, a very inspiring film about choosing the correct route in life.The film's makers depicted some breathtaking views of Ladakh's rugged environment. These sequences were captured using a variety of camera angles, including high angle, crane, and parallax views. These bright images were cleverly employed to suggest that a pleasant and exciting event was on the way. I thought the video was highly informative in the manner it seeks to raise awareness and educate viewers about the rising danger of suicides in India's school system. The tone of the picture shifts quickly from joyful to sorrowful to funny, and so on. As a result, the picture became more exciting since I was continually on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what intriguing incident would unfold. I used to believe that all Bollywood films were low-budget and had bad performers, but I've since learned that some of their actors are very convincing, even by Hollywood standards! These acting talents have inspired me to watch more Bollywood films since they have shown me how exceptional they can be.Thank you."

"a good movie","21 December 2021","10","3 Idiots is a comedy and inspirational film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. This film is based on our Indian educational system which pressurizes the students and has an obsession for high grades. Aamir Khan as Rancho plays the role of a very bright student who motivates his friends pursue their passion and make a career out of it. R. Madhavan as Farhan who wants to become a wildlife photographer but was forced to pursue engineering because of his strict father.Sharman Joshi as Raju who is pursuing engineering with the goal of getting his family out of extreme poverty. Boman Irani as virus who plays the role of a strict college director who is highly competitive. Kareena Kapoor as Pia who plays the role of virus's daughter and falls in love with Aamir khan. The film goes very smooth. The film's first half includes ragging scene, confrontations with the professor, Chatur's speech and mournful meal at Raju's home. Overall the film depicts a very nice mingle of comedy, suspense and motivational. All the actors and co-actors done a commendable job. The music of the film was very soothing. Some of the scenes are really emotional. Overall rating is excellent."
"Not too well","20 November 2011","10","I expected the world out of this movie. Aamir Khan is Only a half decent actor, but Rajkumar Hirani is the man behind the Munnabhai Series, two of the best films in the history of Hindi cinema. But how he disappoints!!! The problems with the movie are the fact that it is too long, has no idea what it is trying to preach. But the big big problem being the fact that it is so so unfunny. Really. The Munnabhai films made you smile and chuckle in almost every scene, but there is such a lack of genuinity in this film, that it gets very hard to do the same here. Maybe it is the poor acting skills, maybe it is the fact that Aamir Khan cannot carry the film well at all, I dunno. Mostly, it must have been my expectations I guess. NOTHING iz well here, don't even bother easting precious time on this. Wish I could rate this even lower, like a negative, but alas...."
"All is well...?","5 February 2020",NA,"The prospect of a knockabout comedy that lasts for over 160 minutes isn't an enticing one, but luckily the title ""3 Idiots"" is something of a misnomer. There's some broad humour, ""comedy"" characters and lots of scatological references, but also depictions of suicide and reflections on the human condition. Western audiences may find this tonal inconsistency hard to take, as an onscreen suicide by hanging is followed by one of many songs.The fifth Aamir Khan movie I've seen, he's an always likeable and engaging presence, but one criticism is that his characters never seem realistically flawed (Save for Dangal). Always the wisest person in the room, his ""think outside the box"" method of living embodies many of his portrayals and his passing of philosophy to his fellow students borders on preaching. Khan has the likeability and charisma to pull this off and prevent it from being too cloying, but in a movie where he becomes a famous scientist, redevises an entire system of learning and delivers a baby, it's something of a surprise to see him near a mass of water at the end of the movie and not start walking on it.Currently on Netflix in the UK, there is some issue with the meaning of words and phrases being changed when translated: I know enough to realise that the subtitled ""ass"" said around an hour into the movie is really ""dog"", but I wasn't aware that balatkar (rape) was said throughout the doctored speech scene, with it changed to a more benign ""screwed"" for the UK audience. An interesting article on how the difference in ratings between men and women could be divided (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-if-online-movie-ratings-werent-based-almost-entirely-on-what-men-think/) shows that this film would be over a hundred places lower if only the votes from women were taken. All, it seems, is not well."
"Gem of a film","27 July 2022","10","Would recommend to everyone. Inspirational, funny, romantic, and very applicable in todays society. It ticks all the boxes and is far better than any western movie I've seen."
"All is well","9 October 2019","10","It may be too long and corny at times, but it is nonetheless a funny, well acted and emotionally resonant movie with a good message.
All is well."
"Very disappointed","16 January 2010",NA,"I was not willing to watch this when it came out but after seeing all the great reviews I thought of giving it a try, which I REALLY regret! This was nothing like I expected and it does not deserve more than 5/10 rating if not less. I usually don't review movies but this just made me so p****d off.Lets start off of acting: It was mostly overacted, especially Boman Irani and Omi Vaidya (aka 'Silencer'). Boman Irani was too bizarre and on the other hand, Omi Vaidya, who was supposed to have a good English accent (or did I get it wrong?) had an accent of a typical South Indian person. In fact, South Indians usually have a better accent from my experience. Aamir, Kareena, Sharman and Madhavan were OK (almost overacted), nothing special.Screenplay/script? Bad. Very bad. Repeats the old boring jokes and offers nothing unique. Looking at the fact they had an advantage of getting the idea off a novel, makes the movie even worse. The whole movie was a combination of stupid jokes which didn't make me laugh one bit (maybe hardly 2 seconds). It almost made me asleep.And about people actually rating this movie high, clearly they don't have much sense about how to judge a movie. Its a shame to see a movie like this getting so much attention while there are many others which are WAY better don't get what the deserve.May be I'm not looking this from a Indian-movie point of view. When you compare to other Indian movies, its actually not bad. But seriously though, if you're gonna include your brain while watching this movie, don't bother.I guess I'm off to watch some good movies now, if you're gonna watch this, good luck getting p****d off."
"Couldn't let go of my couch and popcorn","3 April 2022","9","3 Idiots is a 2009 Bollywood coming-of-age Dramedy movie, it's one of the best Bollywood movies until now. This movie is funny and heartfelt, it can be as dramatic as it's comedic, both equally effective, it also contains a little bit of romance so it makes it more exciting. This movie tells about the bads and goods of the education system in a university. It pressurizes the students and does not allow them to choose their destination by their own wish, in a harsh way. But in the other perspective, it also shows the brighter side of the friendship, how one can motivate and stand by his friend's side.Every single character was so well developed and had a role in that film which really affects the narrative. Every performance was top-notch. Seeing so many jokes the film uses, the possibility of getting the jokes too cheesy was high, but none did. The film balances its emotions so perfectly, I even shed a few tears in some places. Some tears of laughter, some tears of emotional damage.My favorite scene is when Rancho helps Mona give birth and for me, that scene is amazing because Rancho is not a doctor, but only with instructions through a video call from Pia, he can make it. He didn't just deliver Mona's baby, but built a vacuum extractor out of a vacuum cleaner and spare parts, to help the birth. Also, the scene when they met Rancho again. That was a very satisfying scene because they get to meet again after quite a long time. There we can see how Pia is so in love with Rancho that she ran away from her wedding just to search for Rancho. The funniest part is when Chatur found out that Rancho is Mr. Wangdu."
"LOVE IT.","5 September 2021","9","An inspiration for us engineers. A great movie of perseverance and to believe that ""Aal Iz Weell"" :D."
"Best Indian Movie so faaaar","29 December 2023",NA,"""3 Idiots"" is a cinematic gem that profoundly impacts its audience, especially resonating with young engineers and students. The film's brilliance lies in its ability to blend humor, emotion, and thought-provoking themes seamlessly.The narrative follows the journey of three friends navigating the pressures and challenges of an engineering college. Through their experiences, the movie delves deep into the complexities of the education system and societal expectations. It brilliantly addresses the inherent flaws of the rat race mentality, where success is often measured solely by grades and conformity."
"Hits hard and fast","6 November 2021","6","I did not expect to get ""rocked on my chin"" so badly in this film. It has a pace as frenetic as MM: Fury Road, but, somehow, this rapid pace never interferes witb the poignant elements in the film. I suppose (one of the main motifs in the film) that the film moves through both happy and truly depressing/scarring moments alike is to try to mimic life; the happy moments are as brief as the awful moments, so just keep moving forward.From memory, the film reminds me of Dead Poets Society (which I find overly pretentious), but this film is done in a significantly more heartfelt and entertaining way.The characters are real, engrossing, and-often-hilarious. And the kinetic energy of some of the dance numbers is reminiscent of classics such as Singing in the Rain, etc.For various reasons, especially in the darker moments of this film, this is a film I needed to experience right now in this particular moment of my life. Certainly, the film's messages are most relatable to those under 30/35 (in actuality quite a few years younger). Regardless, from cinematography to character development to brilliant mastery of pace, this is a masterpiece."
"Superb Movie","15 September 2021","6","I think all cinephile should watch this movie.....it's amazing."
"3 idiots, one of the best comedies I've ever seen.","19 December 2021",NA,"A satire around three college amigos (3 idiots) that does not let its more genuine topic of self realization, hinder amusement, it takes some time + spreads out its blueprint however takes care of sincerely in its last part.A confound storyline and profoundly persuasive motion pictures to pick the correct way in your life. A drama about a severe dads and their youngsters, exceptionally educational in the way, it looks to bring issues to light and teach watchers about the rising risk of suicides in educational system.3 idiots recount such a kinship , among 3 college mates Madhavan as Farhan, Sharman as Raju and Amir khan as Rancho. Two standard understudies who simply scratch through and the one tremendous impact in their lives expert understudy Rancho, the livewire of the threesome who disturb the Dean of Imperial College of Engineering when tested, every one of them seeking after the field of designing when the one in particular who appears to have an energy for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father to become and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty, with his fathers expensive health bills, his mothers fragile core and his sisters failure to wed all on the table.3 idiots is a brilliant, priceless endeavor in the realm of movies. Its actors are perfectly fitting for their jobs, helped by a content so human and valid for life that it is really difficult to accept and caught through delightfully alive cinematography to all things considered give us an excellent bundle not simply in the non-literal sense.It is a back rub to the guardians of youth and that is to quit applying strain to an all around worried segment. A thought that numerous youngsters are determined what to become in life early and are deterred from investigations or even close to home aspiration.This is perhaps the best satire I have at any point seen. I will rate this 10/10 and would recommend it to everybody.This is Khadija Urooj, enrolled in an undergraduate program at IPP Bahria University. Who loves to play badminton and table tennis, also loves to cook food. An introvert who does not like to share her thoughts but do it to suggest something."
"3 hours too long","12 August 2011","10","I rented this movie largely because of my love for Aamir and the rave reviews on here but in the event it was a disappointment.The film is crude and vulgar in parts. This is something I did not expect from Bollywood. I don't appreciate fart gags in UK/US movies and I certainly didn't like them here.Having 40-odd year old guys playing 18 year old students was somehow more ridiculous than normal --even for a Bollywood movie where, lets face it, reality is the least consideration.But what this film really confirmed to me was that Aamir is always surrounded by second rate actors. The frumpy girlfriend with glasses was as dreary as his two student buddies. There is no one to compete with him here. Other than Dil Chahta Hai, I've never seen him act in an ensemble. For the most part it is the Aamir show all the way. Yes, he's a fabulous actor but having him take center stage with zero competition does him no favors and makes for a boring 3 hours.Nope, sorry. I found the film a bore and I expected better."
"comedy movie with message","30 August 2016","10","The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's speech, the three some's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track. Aamir does it again. what a movie .from start to the end, hilarious moments.screenplay is fantastic. full on comedy and yet it never looses its heart. pulls off a 22 year old character with brilliance. never for once you feel you are watching. music looks OK"
"Epic comical bollywood classic movie","1 April 2023",NA,"If you are looking for a light comedy film to watch, maybe this is the answer. You must add this film to your watch list.The film is an adaptation of Chetan Bhagat's bestselling novel ""Five Point Someone"" and tells the story of 3 students who are accepted at a prestigious college in India called the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) where they only accept 200 students out of 400,000 applicants each year and have to suffer under the pressure of the educational system and has to faced the campus professor, Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), who the three derogatorily call ""Virus"" when his back is turned who has no empathy and humanity to his student.Rancho, Raju, and Farhan are the three lead characters in the movie. Funny, fearless, and unyielding character, Ranchhoddas ""Rancho"" Shamaldas Chhanchad (Aamir Khan) is portrayed as a free-spirited and intelligent engineering student who is passionate about learning and innovation. Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) the jittery, uncertain character is portrayed as a more serious student who is driven by the desire to provide for his family. Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), the ambitious but stunned character is portrayed as a student who is interested in photography but is studying engineering due to family pressure.One of the most intriguing aspects of the movie is the way it portrays the education system as an oppressive force that stifles creativity and individuality. This theme is perfectly illustrated in the scene where the character Rancho, played by Aamir Khan, challenges the conventional approach to education by using a creative and practical approach to teach his classmates. The scene is both entertaining and thought-provoking, as it questions the traditional methods of education and highlights the importance of creativity and innovation.Another notable scene is the climax, which brings all the themes and storylines together in a powerful and emotional way. The scene depicts the ultimate triumph of knowledge and friendship over societal expectations and cultural norms. It is a moving portrayal of the value of human connection and the transformative power of education.The performances in ""3 Idiots"" are outstanding, with Aamir Khan delivering a standout performance as the rebellious Rancho. His character is both charismatic and enigmatic, and he perfectly captures the essence of a person who refuses to conform to societal norms with his slogan ""All izz well"" (All Is Well) in every tense moment. Kareena Kapoor, who plays the love interest of two of the main characters, is also exceptional, bringing depth and complexity to a character that could have easily been one-dimensional.""3 Idiots"" briefly touches upon the issue of suicide rates in India, particularly among students who are under immense pressure to succeed academically. In one scene, the character of Raju attempts to take his own life after feeling overwhelmed by the pressures of his studies and the weight of his family's expectations. The film uses this scene to highlight the issue of suicide among students in India, which is a growing concern. According to a report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), in 2019, there were over 10,000 student suicides in India. The report also found that the main reasons for these suicides were academic pressure, failure in exams, and relationship issues. Through its portrayal of the character of Raju, ""3 Idiots"" shows how the education system and societal expectations can take a toll on students' mental health and well-being. The film encourages viewers to think critically about the importance of mental health and the need for a more supportive and inclusive education system that prioritizes the well-being of students.Overall, this film was a fantastic bollywood movie. The characters in the film are not limited by their assigned roles and each of them has their own unique strengths and weaknesses. ""3 Idiots"" also raises important issues about education that encourage students to think critically about the purpose of their education and avoid becoming mere ""robots"" in real life. This film serves as an opportunity for viewers to evaluate the education system and explore ways to improve it.The only weakness of this film is about the duration that too long. Some people maybe get bored while watching this film and don't get the main point of this film. Also, this film are not appropriate for children underage because it contains some of pornography phrase, suicidal thought, and harassment.Bet this the most epic bollywood film in this decade. Talking about education and mental health but covering with light comedy that will make you laughing and crying."
"This movie is an anomaly in the top 250 list","27 April 2020","6","This review is specifically for folks who are watching the 250 list. This movie doesn't deserve to be there. There is nothing special about the movie. You have been warned."

"Movie Review","6 June 2022","9","One of my favorite movie. I saw it many many time. This movie give me different kind of feelings. This movie inspire me to learn any things by deeply."
"The magic of Aamir Khan","26 December 2009","9","With over six months of publicity, gossip, word of mouth, twitter updates, scandals, facebook applications, college debates and disappearing acts later finally Three Idiots released in theaters on the 25th of December 2009. Obviously, the first thought that comes to mind is, will the movie be up to snuff with the expectations it has created? Will i be happy with the comedy or is it going to be the few lines shown in the premiere? Is the movie going to be a typical Hindi film or something more?If i may?,i would like to stick my neck out and say that the movie was good. In that it satisfied my senses for the three hours that i was in the theater. As my friend put it, there was never a moment that our attention veered away from the screen. We never felt disconnected from the plot, never uninterested. The direction was beautiful, it was as if some brilliant student from college wanted to try something new and had brought in that fresh outlook. Also it was like a college graduate, as there was hardly an extra scene, the songs also told a tale and meant something. Cinematography, rarely do you see movies paying so much attention to detail. The lighting, the angles and the backdrop shots were great. I especially like the Pandong Lake scene, the tourism department could do with using shots like that and getting people to go to Ladakh. I am going in 2010. The acting in the movie was very free flowing, it didn't seem like there were any plastics in any of the scenes which is very refreshing. Boman Irani seemed a little repetitive with the whole Dr. Asthana acting in the movie but he kicked ass as an emotional dad. Kareena, Madhavan, Sharmaan were good in their supporting roles. Personally loved that Madhavan was the narrator.Aamir Khan - GeniusThe real hero in this movie is the well thought out plot and dialogue. The plot is going somewhere, has a direction and up to the last 20 minutes you do not really know where that is. Highlighting the current education system was worthwhile. Unfortunately the last 20 were a lot like a typical Hindi film, which is not always such a bad thing.All said and done, is this movie going to be viewed and appreciated by future generations? I hope so"
"Good movie but not as good as it is rated","23 January 2012",NA,"This is a good movie overall. But the rating of 8.2 is quite high for this movie. Secondly the genres of this movie were not rightly match with the movie. Anyway, let me first talk about what I liked in this movie. I like it overall. It is entertaining, good comedy and of course good acting by Boman Irani, Sharman Joshi and Madhavan. The main theme of the movie was a concept that the passion of person when matches with his profession, he achieves success. So the concept wise it is good. Screen play and Direction were good overall but not incredible. Now what I did not like about this movie. Full focus of this movie was Aamir. But I did not find Amir's acting as much appealing compared to others. He was energetic but acting wise, not that good. Secondly, the movie, as per the genre is concerned, is not a romantic movie. So overall, it is good movie. Good composition, good direction, but to my view it does not rank among the best movies of bollywood."
"Evergreen","6 November 2021","6","All the favorite. One of my favourites. Whenever i watch this i feel connected with the story and I'm sure everyone feels the same. I cannot describe how i feel whenever I watch this masterpiece of raju amir sharman n madhvan."
"A satisfactory meal, but not the best...","29 December 2009","6","The movie starts of well with excellent wit and moves along a pretty good pace that sets up the rest of the movie. 3 Idiots is all about 3 friends – Rancho, Raju and Farhan (Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and R Madhavan respectively) who have been accepted into a prestigious institute and set about to pursue their dreams.The three lead actors share excellent chemistry, along with the authoritarian principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani) and the ever competing bookworm Chatur Ramalingam (portrayed by Omi Vaidya) in an excellent role that gives life to the movie. The humor is pretty good in the movie. And the way the director has managed to intertwine both comedy and sentiments subtly is applaudable.Going to the negative aspects, I felt that some of the humor has been taken up shrewdly from the internet, the scenes which include Rancho pawning the campus director after his speech about his acclaimed astronaut pen, and then there's the scene where Rancho mixes up their exam papers among the pile of papers of other students. These jokes have been doing rounds on the internet for years now.Then there's the need to insert a love story into the movie in the most conventional way possible. The usual bollywood type love story, the girl (Pia played by Kareena Kapoor) doesn't like the guy at first. And then the hero manages to weave magic (Chamatkaar or Balatkaar, choose for yourself) around her which leaves her intoxicated enough to fall for our irresistible Rancho.Hirani also manages to push the limits a li'l far with some scenes, there is a scene wherein Rancho tries to extract a baby using a vacuum cleaner which he manages to assemble all and well within a few mins when our woman is in deep pain (literally), and then there is the succeeding scene where the baby isn't breathing. However, it comes to life when everyone starts chanting the tagline 'Aal izz well' (really???) The rest of the movie is well done which still makes it a full paisa vasool movie despite the flaws. Well written and most importantly surpassed by better acting by the actors who make up the movie. It would have been awesome if the the writer had managed to come up with some more original ideas. But still 3 idiots is one of the better Hindi cinemas this year. This is definitely not Hirani's best work, but one of the better one's indeed!!! There will always be talk about how movies aren't supposed to be taken too seriously, which is absolutely true. But in the end, its the feeling that you walk out with, that will define your contentment. If you read this review, you will find most of it is filled with negative aspects. The reason being, the rest of the movie is truly excellent, laced with sentiment and humor, which is a definite watch. Watch it!!"
"endless unfunny repetitive pointless","6 April 2013",NA,"honestly - it took me 3 days to get through this two hour plus tale of three guys and their memories! this story could have easily been told much more effectively in 45 minutes or one hour.the plot line is like crabgrass! as soon as you think you have pulled it all up there's yet more and it all looks alike! endless and repetitive and predictable!the 'emotional' scenes are just laughable - then it is suppose to be a comedy - but the funny parts are few and far between. and if this film was a hit in India - then i do not know what would be considered a Bollywood flop.i have seen few other Bollywood movies and none are as miserable as this idiotic movie."
"Engaging Storyline","23 November 2023","10","Aamir Khan's portrayal of the central character, Rancho, is both charismatic and emotionally resonant. His performance adds depth to the film and makes Rancho a memorable character. The film presents a compelling storyline that revolves around the pursuit of passion and knowledge rather than blindly following societal expectations. The narrative is well-crafted, balancing humor with thought-provoking themes.""3 Idiots"" is known for its humor and witty dialogues. The comedic elements, often delivered by the three lead characters, contribute to the film's overall entertainment value. The supporting cast, including R. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Kareena Kapoor, and Boman Irani, deliver noteworthy performances. The chemistry between the lead actors adds authenticity to the characters' friendships."
"Full of Life Lessons","4 August 2021","10","Even though parts of the movie can be a bit corny (it is a Bollywood movie after all), this is a pretty incredible movie that everyone should see. I west expecting a silly comedy, but this movie is full of valuable life lessons and heartfelt relationships instead."
"Awesome","15 March 2022",NA,"3 Idiots is the perfect end to an exciting year for India: the year when the aam aadmi voted in progress, liberalism, secularism and turned his back to corruption, communalism, regionalism."
"Best Bollywood movie","25 September 2021","7","It's a story of a three friends in a college and their life after college . It's very humorous, inspiring and funny at the same time . It will take you back to your student life and make you remember different good and bad aspect of it . It will make you realise how important friendship is and how it matters to an individual . It will guide you to realise how important it is to follow your heart rather than succumb to society pressure and follow the path you are not interested. You will get motivated , cry and believe me laugh at the same time . Go watch it , you won't regret and will definitely create a strong impact on your life . Cheers 😊"
"Awesome","27 September 2021","7","A must watch movie. Great story and superb acting from actors."
"3 Idiots- A life changeable and motivational movie","18 June 2021",NA,"Three Idiots' is a remarkable ahead of its time Bollywood blockbuster. This film is a comedy movie with strong acting, memorable characters, a perplexing storyline and most importantly, highly motivational movie to choose the right path in your life.The producers of the movie expressed some amazing scenery of the mountainous landscape of Ladakh. These scenes were taken with various different camera angles such as high angle, crane and parallax shots. These colourful scenes were ingeniously used to infer that a happy and exiting moment was to come. I felt as though the film was very educational in the way that it tries to spread awareness and teach the viewers of the increasing risk of the school system related suicides in India. The mood of this film changes rapidly from joyous to depressing to comedic etc. In doing so, it made the film more exiting as I was always at the edge of my seat unknowing what fascinating event will take place. I used to think all Bollywood films are low budget with atrocious actors, but now I realised how incredibly convincing some of their actors are, even for Hollywood standards! These acting capabilities I have witnessed set a great example to me of how extraordinary Bollywood films can be and it intrigues me to watch more.Overall, 'Three Idiots' was an amazing film that really impressed me of how good Bollywood films can be. My emotions throughout the film was like a roller coaster, going from sad to jubilant in a matter of seconds. I mainly recommend this film to anyone who is unsure of watching a Bollywood film, yet I also recommend this film to every other person in the entirety of the earth."
"Numero uno idiots!","26 December 2009","1","Direction - outstanding, Script - excellent, Dialogues - Well written, Acting - 10 out of 10, Comedy - mind blowing, Emotions - great, Message - too good, (specially for Indian parents) Whatever else you find left out, add full marks from my side. Rajkumar Hirani's earlier movies - Munna Bhai series, were all exapmles well crafted arts. Which answers all the question about his caliber. I have also heard that script of Lage Raho being added to Academy's Library of scripts. By this movies he proves yet again what he can create. He is simply among one of the best directors present in the country today. RajKumar Hirani + Aamir Khan, upon a Chetan Bhagat's best selling novel and you will find - 3 idiots!. I loved the message most as it matches with the need for today. I remember myself being imposed the dream of becoming an engineer. It beautifully captures the emotions of such students and the pressure because of their family. Dialogues has simple words but at the same time well thought out ones and one of the few i loved was from the suicide scene - ""I Quit"" - least use of words and maximum results.One of Aamir's best ever!!A MUST WATCH FOR EVERYONE."
"likable if bloated screwball comedy","14 July 2012","1","When it comes to running-time, why does Bollywood treat every movie as if it were a sweeping historical epic on the order of a ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or a ""Doctor Zhivago?"" A case in point: ""3 Idiots,"" an amiable enough little screwball comedy that has been padded out to a wrist-slashing 164 minutes. It also happens to be the most commercially successful Bollywood feature ever released in India. Go figure.The story centers around a trio of promising but mischievous young engineering students who rebel against the high-pressured rigidity - both academic and personal - of the exclusive school they're attending.""3 Idiots"" has two things going for it: its cranked-up energy level and its appealing actors, especially Aamir Khan, who portrays the ringleader of the group. These alone are enough to compensate for the silliness of much of the action, the corniness of the jokes (with irritating cue music in case we couldn't pick up on the corn on our own) and the stickiness of the sentimentality. And, in its own playful way, the movie makes some important points about the intense pressure placed on Indian children to achieve beyond their parents' wildest expectations, and about the need to pursue the path that will make one most happy in life.It's a pretty entertaining feature, overall; I just wish it didn't take so darn long to play itself out."
"Aal izz well","12 April 2022",NA,"3 Idiots is an Indian comedy film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. This film was based on a novel called 'Five Point Someone' that was written by an Indian author, Chetan Bhagat. This film was released in 2009 and became a success as it became one of the most popular films worldwide at that time.3 Idiots tells us a story of three buddies named Rancho, Farhan, and Raju who attend the Imperial College of Engineering, an elite college in India. This film conveys and judges the educational system of India. Aamir Khan played Rancho in the role of a genius and motivational student. Ranganathan Madhayan played Farhan who was forced by his strict father to pursue engineering but has a dream to become a wildlife photographer. Sharman Joshi as Raju who is pursuing engineering to get his family out of poverty but is struggling to keep up with uni-life. Another character who played a big role in this film is their extremely-strict dean, Viru Sahastrabuddhe who was played by Boman Irani.I don't find myself watching Bollywood films that much. Especially comedy. I was kinda doubtful before watching this film even though my friend said it's one of the best films she has ever watched. A long 3 hours of comedy just didn't sit right with me- That was before I gave it a try to watch this. Never thought that this could turn out so good. It didn't start that well for me- but getting into the film for an hour, it was starting to get so entertaining and interesting. 3 idiots had success to make these 3 hours feel like nothing for me. The film; no doubt- leaves a great impression on me. I love how smooth the storyline goes. I never get confused when the timeline changes from ten years ago to the present. I experienced such a roller coaster of emotion watching this film. . Maybe because it is a Bollywood film, I didn't expect any particular scenes so the storyline for me wasn't predictable. All the humorous situations are present but then the story pulls back with a serious situation; poignant moments which could get you on nerves or even cry. This film was so nicely made; thanks to the wonderful script and the outstanding acting of the cast.This film surely tells you about the meaning of life; also a wholesome and meaningful friendship between these 3 'idiots'. The message in this film- I don't find anything new, I've been hearing from here and there that big grades don't mean success. You gotta believe in yourself, do your passion, and don't let others choose your life path. I'm always on the same page with this quote-unquote life advice. But this film opened my eyes wider and wider. It was because of the twist at the end of the film. Revealing the identity of Rancho. He proves that all he's saying to his friends and teacher throughout the story is right; don't chase success. Achieve excellence and it will come to you itself. He
proved it in a way that I didn't expect, I was shocked in fact. I'm not going to say the details and spoils each scene that was memorable for me. You better watch this film for yourself at least once. Just throw yourself to watch it. I bet you'll have a great time with all the comedies and twists that you'll never expect."
"Opinion","17 October 2017","10","Didn't find it an awesome film but a regular film. There's two perspectives I shall mention: first one isthat there's much drama involved and that's why i only rate it with 6 stars; however there's some laughing moments with funny scenes. The crew was a nice selection. The actors had a nice role. The involving ambient doesn't show people the reality of India."
"Not an EPIC movie","11 May 2013","10","Its been while that this movie is out. There are many better movies made in the Indian film industry which have a far better script and a story line than this movie. I was quite surprised to see this movie of IMDb 250 list, doesn't deserve it at all. Probably a movie like Lagaan or Jodha Akbar might have been a better choice over 3 Idiots which basically is for the younger generation and like most of the movies delivers a common message. I am not quite sure how it got 8.1..The most ridiculous part was the delivery of a baby using a vacuum cleaner, common people who are watching not dumb, can they point out a single instance. That scene almost ruined the movie. Overall, it is just an outright commercial movie for the youth and the masses, nothing fantastic."
"One of the best movie of bollywood","1 February 2022",NA,"It is all about life and perspective towards it. Here he just shown doing things differently can change your world and the world around you. Se this movie with your family or loved once to get amazing experience!"
"Awesome","26 April 2022","8","The best movie I've ever seen! I rewatched many times and never bored. This movie gave me motivation to majoring Engineering in university. I love the soundtrack too."
"Watch it atleast once in lifetime!","15 April 2022","8","It comprises of the perfect package of every ingredient required in a feature film. Well-written and also well made epic package for all kind of cinema lovers. Aamir khan justifies his role more than required and also becomes a proven example of what makes a man really successful in life. Seems fresh though its been years since I have seen the movie."
"Make your own decisions","2 July 2021",NA,"I really thought that this movie was just comedy and having fun during college, then halfway through it took a slightly dark turn. Very good, and the drama is good. 9/10 will watch again."
"Amazing!!!","30 June 2021","10","One of the best movies that I've ever seen! I've lost count of how many times I've watched this movie. Never felt bored while watching. Well written and directed by Rajkumar Hirani and the cast was also superb, especially Aamir Khan and Boman Irani."
"What an Inspiring and Incredible Film","1 April 2022","10","3 Idiots is a comedy-drama Bollywood film with a bit of a musical genre. The story starts with two friends, Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman), who misses their lost friend from college, Rancho (Aamir Khan). They have been searching for him since they graduated, but no one knows where he is. And one day, Chatur (Omi), a guy who hates Rancho in college, contacted them and stated that he knows where Rancho is. So the three of them set out on a journey to find their lost friend. The story is about a beautiful friendship of the 'three idiots' and a satire about the Indian education system at that time.My favorite scene of the film was when Farhan successfully convinced his father that he wanted to quit engineering and start his career as a photographer. At first, his father was angry at his decision. But after all the emotional conversations, he finally decides to support his son. And also the scene when Raju did his job interview. He answered all the questions straightforwardly. Then the interviewers stated that they would accept him if he changed his straightforward attitude. But Raju declined the offer. He said that he doesn't want to change himself. However, the interviewers found him interesting and unique, so he got accepted for the job. I found both scenes interesting because it's the start of their new journey. Raju finally comes out of his fear, and Farhan finally does what he loves. And after the scenes, they both pay respect to Rancho, which is very emotional and heart-warming.For me, this movie is like a full-course meal. You could get all types of emotions with this film. I could feel happiness, sadness, anger, and other emotions just by watching it. I also love how they brought up serious issues, such as social pressure, depression, mental illness, suicide, the education system, etc. Rajkumar Hirani, the director of this film, did an amazing job by covering all of those issues in one film. This movie has two timelines in the plot. But you never really get confused by it because it is very organized. The movie is also very well-paced and entertaining. Although it is an almost-3 hours long movie, it didn't feel so long and was not boring at all. The actor and actresses also did a great job nailing their roles. The soundtrack in the film suits well in each of the scenes.3 Idiots is such a 10/10 film for me, because of the story itself. All the details in the movie successfully complemented the story. The message they were trying to give us is delivered very well. This movie told us to follow our passion, fight our fears, to remember our friends who fought with us from the beginning, and also to cherish every moment of our life because it all will become memories."
"My new favorite semesterly tradition","8 June 2019",NA,"""It's not a good movie. But it _is_ a great one."" -My Dear Friend Owen"
"Am I missing something this movie is mediocre and waaayy to long","19 September 2019","9","Is it worth watching, short answer no. Is it worth watching if you are a fan of Bollywood, I guess. Is this movie anywhere near the 8.2 The world of IMDbers have given it no way. The acting is mediocre, the laughs are just ok, the obligatory dance sequences leave this American scratching his head. The length at almost 3 hours is way too long for a movie of this sort. And the hero, is well kind of a jerk not a loveable rebel (a quality I usually love to see). And there is way too much predictability in the plot. I dont watch very much Indian cinema, my favorite Indian flick is monsoon wedding, now that was a great film. This was mediocre on a good day."
